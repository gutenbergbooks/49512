<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI<br />

<small id="DISTRIBUTION_SYSTEMS">DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS</small></h2>


<p>The selection of the system of transmission and distribution
of electric energy from the generating plant to lamps, motors,
and other devices, is governed mainly by the cost of the metallic
conductors, which in many electrical installations, is a larger
item than the cost of the generating plant itself. This is especially
true in case of long distance transmission, while in those of the
lighting plants, the cost of wiring is usually more expensive than
that of the boilers, engines, and generators combined.</p>

<p>The principal distribution systems, are classed as:</p>

<p>
1. Series;<br />
2. Parallel;<br />
3. Series-parallel;<br />
4. Parallel-series.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the characteristic feature of each class?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In the series systems the current is constant, but the
voltage varies. In the parallel systems, the voltage is constant,
but the current varies.</p>

<p id="SERIES_SYSTEM_OF_DISTRIBUTION"><b>Series System of Distribution.</b>—A series system affords
the simplest arrangement of lamps, motors, or other devices
supplied with electric energy. The connections of such a system
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_698">698</span>
are shown in <a href="#fig0783">fig. 783</a>. The current from the terminal of the
dynamo passes through the lamps, L, L, L, L, one after the other
and finally returns to the terminal. The current remains practically
constant, but the voltage falls throughout the circuit in
direct proportion to the resistance, and the difference in pressure
between any two points in the circuit is equal to the current in
amperes multiplied by the resistance in ohms included between
them.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For example. Each open arc lamp requires about 50 volts. In the
system shown in <a href="#fig0783">fig. 783</a>, the pressure measured across the brushes of
the dynamo is assumed to be 1,000 volts. As this current flows through
the circuit 45 volts will be actually lost in each lamp, and as the drop on
the line wire is usually about 10 per cent. of the total voltage, there will
be a drop of 5 volts on the conductor between any two lamps. In the
circuit shown, there are twenty lamps, therefore, the difference in pressure
between either terminal of the dynamo and middle point A of the
circuit will be 10 lamps &times; 50 volts = 500 volts. Likewise, the difference
in pressure between any two points on the circuit will be equal to 50
volts multiplied by the number of lamps included between them.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 783.—Series system of distribution. This is a constant current system, so called because
the current remains practically constant. It is used chiefly for arc lighting.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the danger in a series arc light system?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Since the total voltage of the system is equal to the sum
of the volts consumed in all of the lamps, it is high enough to be
dangerous to personal safety.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_699">699</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>This is illustrated in <a href="#fig0783">fig. 783</a>. If the line be grounded at B owing to
defective insulation, the pressure of the circuit at that point will be zero,
and therefore, a man standing on the ground could touch that point
without receiving a shock, but if he should touch the line at the point C,
he will receive a slight shock of 150 volts, as there are three lamps between
the point C, and the ground connection B. Therefore, the danger
of touching the circuit increases directly with the resistance between the
point touched and the ground connection, so that if a man touch the
circuit at the point D, he will receive a dangerous shock of 16 &times; 50 = 800
volts. In practice, sixty lamps are often placed on a single arc lighting
circuit, so that its total pressure is about 3,000 volts, thus greatly increasing
the danger of the system.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is a constant current system?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The series system is a constant current system, and is
so called because the current remains practically constant, while
the voltage falls throughout the circuit in direct proportion to
the resistance.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the principal applications of the series
system?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For arc lighting, and telegraphic circuits.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the advantages of the series system?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In the case of telegraphic circuits only one wire is
required, and for lighting and power transmission and distribution,
only two wires; therefore, it is simpler and cheaper
than any other system.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the disadvantage of the series system?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The danger due to the high voltage in installations
such as arc lighting circuits.</p>

<p><b>Parallel System.</b>—Parallel or multiple systems are usually
more complicated than series systems, but since the voltage can
be maintained nearly constant by various methods, practically
all incandescent lamps, electric motors, and a large proportion
of arc lamps are supplied by parallel systems.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_700">700</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The general principle of the parallel system is shown in <a href="#fig0784">fig. 784</a>. With
six lamps on the circuit, each requiring one-half ampere of current, at
110 volts, the dynamo will have to supply a current of 3 amperes at a
pressure of 112 volts, and this current will flow through the circuit and
distribute itself as shown on account of the lesser resistance of the wire
relatively to that of the lamps. At the first lamp, the 3 amperes will
divide, &frac12; ampere flowing through the lamp and the remaining 2&frac12;
amperes passing on to the next lamp and so on through the entire circuit.
The reduction of pressure from 112 volts across the brushes to 110 volts
at the last lamp is due to the resistance of the conducting wires.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What three effects are due to this drop in
pressure?</b></p>

<p>Ans. 1, All the lamps or motors in the circuit receive a lower
voltage than that at the dynamo, 2, some lamps or motors may
receive a lower voltage than the others, and 3, the voltage at some
lamps or motors may vary when the others are turned on or off.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 784.—Parallel system of distribution. This is a constant voltage system and is used
principally for incandescent lighting and electric motor circuits.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The first is the least harmful and may be counteracted by running
the dynamo at a little higher voltage; but the second and third are very
objectionable and difficult to overcome. They are counteracted successfully
in practice, however, by various methods of regulation, the use of
<i>boosters</i>, and the operation of dynamos in parallel.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What are the principal applications of parallel
or constant pressure systems?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are used on practically all incandescent lamp and
electric motor circuits, and on some arc lamp circuits.

<p><b>Ques. Why is it specially applicable to incandescent
lamp circuits?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Incandescent lamps cannot be made to stand a pressure
much over 220 volts, and therefore have to be operated on low
voltage systems.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the principal disadvantage of a parallel
system as compared with a series system?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The greater cost of the copper conductors.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the usual arrangement of parallel
systems?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Conductors known as <i>a feeder</i> run out from the station,
and connected to these are other conductors known as <i>a main</i>
to which in turn the lamps or other devices are connected as
shown in <a href="#fig0785">fig. 785</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. In what two ways may feeders be connected?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They may be connected at the same end of the mains,
known as <i>parallel feeding</i>, or they may be connected at the
opposite end of the main, called <i>anti-parallel feeding</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_702">702</span></p>


<blockquote>

<p>The main may be of uniform cross section throughout, or it may
change in size so as to keep the current density approximately constant.

diminishing the size of wire so that the relation between circular rails and amperes
is kept approximately constant. In an anti-parallel system, the current is fed to

<p><b>Series-Parallel System.</b>—This is a combination of the series
and parallel systems, and is arranged as indicated in <a href="#fig0790">fig. 790</a>.
Several lamps are arranged in parallel to form a group, and a
number of such sets are connected in series, as shown. It is not
necessary for the groups to be identical, provided they are all
adapted to take the same current in amperes, which should be
kept constant, and provided the lamps of each set agree in voltage.
For example, on the ordinary 10-ampere arc circuit, one group
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_703">703</span>
might consist of 5 lamps, each requiring 2 amperes at 50 volts;
the next might be composed of 10 lamps, each taking 1 ampere
at 100 volts, and so on.</p>

<p><b>Ques. When is a parallel-series system used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. When it is desired to operate a number of lamps or
motors on a line where voltage is several times that required to
operate a single lamp or motor.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The parallel-series system is employed chiefly in the lighting circuit
on electric traction lines; here, usually five 110 volt lamps are connected
to the source of supply which has a pressure of 550 volts.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_704">704</span></p>

<p><b>Center of Distribution.</b>—It is important to determine the
point at which the feeders should be attached to the mains in
order to minimize the amount of copper required. The method
employed is similar to that used in determining the best location
of a power plant as regards amount of copper required. The
center of distribution may be called the electrical center of
gravity of the system, and is found by separately obtaining the
center of gravity of straight sections and then determining the
total resultant and point of application of this resultant of the
straight sections.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Feeders (feeding cables or conductors) are run from the source of
supply to the distributing centers, and, as these feeders are in many
cases of considerable length, a substantial loss of pressure generally
occurs in them. The pressure at the source of supply, however, is so
regulated as to compensate for the drop in the feeders, and the pressure
at the distributing centers is thus kept constant; or the same result is
obtained by the use of regulating devices in the feeders. The essential
condition in most systems is that the pressure at the distributing centers
shall be kept practically constant, irrespective of the load.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Edison Three Wire System.</b>—In electric lighting systems
used up to about 1897, it was not considered practicable to use
incandescent lamps requiring a pressure exceeding 120 volts.
This limited the operating voltage of parallel systems, and
necessitated the use of conductors of large size and weight,
especially where the current had to be transmitted a considerable
distance.</p>

<p>The effect of this limiting voltage is more apparent when it is
clearly understood that the size of wire required to carry a current
depends upon the amperes and not upon the volts.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A wire capable of carrying a current of 10 amperes at 20 volts, can
carry 10 amperes at 20,000 volts or any other voltage. Therefore, since
the amount of electric energy or power transmitted through a conductor
is equal to the amperes multiplied by the volts, it is clear that
by increasing the voltage, the power transmitting capacity of a current
can be almost indefinitely increased without increasing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_705">705</span>
size of the conducting wire. This is the reason why considerations of
economy dictate the use of the highest voltages possible in long distance
transmissions. The voltage of the current is determined, however, by
the requirements of the apparatus to be operated.</p>

<p>Incandescent lamps usually require a pressure of 110 volts, and the
current required by a 16 candle power lamp at that voltage is about &frac12;
ampere. Therefore if the lamp be designed for a pressure of 220 volts,
the current will be reduced to &frac14; ampere, and the same size of wire could
be used to feed twice as many lamps.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 792 and 793.—Evolution of the three wire system. Fig. 792 shows two dynamos supplying
two independent circuits. These may be connected in series as in <a href="#fig0793">fig. 793</a>, thus
operating the two circuits of <a href="#fig0792">fig. 792</a> with two wires instead of four. To balance the
system in case of unequal loading, a third or <i>neutral wire</i> is used as shown in <a href="#fig0794">fig. 794</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The saving of copper is the sole merit of the three wire
system, and the object which led to its invention was to effect
this economy with the use of 110 volt lamps.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_706">706</span></p>

<p><b>Principle of the Three Wire System.</b>—In <a href="#fig0792">fig. 792</a>, two
dynamos A and B are shown supplying two independent incandescent
lighting circuits, each circuit receiving 3 amperes of
current at a pressure of 110 volts. It is evident that the dynamos
could be connected with each other in series, and the lamps connected
in series with two each, as shown in <a href="#fig0793">fig. 793</a>, thus making
the two wires K and L of the two independent circuits unnecessary,
as the pressure will be increased to 220 volts while
the current will remain at 3 amperes, and each lamp will require
&frac14; ampere.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig0794" src="images/fig0794.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap"> Fig</span>. 794.—Balanced three wire system. The middle conductor, known as the <i>neutral wire</i>,
keeps the system balanced in case of unequal loading, that is, a current will flow through
it, to or from the dynamos, according to the preponderance of lamps on the one side or the
other. These current conditions are shown in <a href="#fig0797">fig. 797</a>.</p>
</div>

<p>The amount of copper saved will be 100 per cent., but this
arrangement is open to the objection, that when one of the lamps
is turned off, or burned out, its companion will also go out. This
difficulty is avoided in the three wire system by running a third
wire N, from the junction O, between the two dynamos, as shown
in <a href="#fig0794">fig. 794</a>, thus providing a supply or return conductor to any
one of the lamps, and permitting any number of lamps to be
disconnected without affecting those which remain. If the
system be exactly balanced, no current will flow through the wire
N, because the pressure <i>toward</i> the - terminal of the dynamo A,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_707">707</span>
will be equal to the pressure <i>from the</i> + terminal of dynamo B,
thus neutralizing the pressure in the wire. For this reason the
middle wire of a three wire system is called the <i>neutral wire</i>, and
is usually indicated by the symbol O or &plusmn; the latter meaning
that it is positive to the first wire and negative to the second.
If the system be unbalanced, a current will flow through the
neutral wire, to or from the dynamos, according to the preponderance
of lamps in the upper or lower sets. When the number
in the lower set is the greater, the current in the neutral wire
will flow <i>from</i> the dynamos as shown in <a href="#fig0797">fig. 797</a>, and <i>toward</i> the
dynamos under the reverse condition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the case represented in <a href="#fig0797">fig. 797</a>, there are five lamps in circuit,
requiring 2&frac12; amperes of current at a pressure of 110 volts. The two
lamps in the upper set will require 1 ampere, and the three lamps in the
lower set, 1&frac12; amperes. Since a pressure of 110 volts can force only a
current of one ampere through resistance of the two lamps in the upper
set, it is evident, that the additional &frac12; ampere required by the three
lamps in the lower set will have to be supplied through the neutral wire,
as shown.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Balancing of Three Wire System.</b>—In practice it is impossible
to obtain an exactly balanced system, as the turning on and
off of lamps as required results in a preponderance of lamps in
the upper or lower sets, and furthermore, even when the number
of lamps in the two sets are equal, they may be located irregularly,
thereby causing the currents to flow for short distances in the
neutral line. Therefore, the larger the number of lamps in the
circuit, the easier it will be to keep the system in a balanced
condition.</p>

<p><b>Copper Economy in Three Wire Systems.</b>—Theoretically,
the size of the neutral wire has to be only sufficient to carry the
largest current that will pass through it. A large margin of
safety, however, is allowed in practice so that its cross section
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_708">708</span>
ranges from about one-third that of the outside line, in large
central station systems, to the same as that of each outside line
in small isolated systems.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If the neutral wire be made one-half the size of the outside conductor,
as is usually the case in feeders, the amount of copper required is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub>
of that necessary for the two wire system. For mains it is customary
to make all three conductors the same size increasing the amount of
copper to ⅜ of that required for the two wire system.</p></blockquote>

direct current dynamo, the armature A and pole pieces N and S of which are shown. A
self-induction coil D, is connected to two diametrically opposite points of the winding of
the armature A. The coil D may be carried by and revolve with the armature; but in the
construction represented, it is stationary, being connected to the armature winding through
the brushes CC, rings and wires JJ. The middle point of the
self-induction coil D, is connected
to the neutral conductor O of the three wire system, the outside conductors + and
- being supplied from the brushes BB in the usual manner. The pressure at the terminals
of the coil D is alternating; hence the latter, on account of its self-induction, does
not act as a short circuit to the armature. Furthermore, the inductances of the two halves
of the coil D being equal, the pressure of the neutral wire O is kept midway between the
pressures of the outside wires + and -. When the two sides of the system are unbalanced
in load, the difference in current carried in one direction or the other by the
neutral wire passes freely through the coil D, since the current is steady, or varies slowly,
and is therefore unimpeded by the self-induction. It is evident that the ohmic resistance
of D should be as low and its self-induction as high as possible, in order that the loss of
energy and the difference in voltage on the two sides of the system shall be as small as
possible under all conditions.</p>

<p><b>Modifications of the Three Wire System.</b>—By the employment
of suitable arrangements, it is possible to operate a

arrangements which have been used or proposed in this connection
may be briefly mentioned as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_709">709</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Three Wire Storage Battery System</b>, in which a storage battery
is connected between the two outside wires, and the pressure of the neutral
wire varied to balance the system by shifting the point at which it
is connected to the battery.</p>

<p><b>Three Wire Double Dynamo System</b>, in which a double dynamo
having two armature windings upon the same core, connected to two
separate commutators, is used in the same manner as two separate
dynamos connected in series.</p>

<p><b>Three Wire Bridge System</b>, in which a resistance is connected
across the two outside wires, and the neutral wire is brought to a point
on the resistance through a movable switch. The pressures on the two
sides of the circuit are equalized by adjusting the arm of the switch for
any change of load.</p>

<p><b>Three Wire Auxiliary Dynamo System</b>, in which the neutral wire
is connected to an auxiliary dynamo which supplies a pressure one-half
as great as that of the main dynamo. The auxiliary dynamo is usually
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_710">710</span>
belt driven by the main dynamo, and acts as a dynamo when the load is
greater on the negative side of the circuit, and as a motor when the excess
of load is on the positive side.</p>

<p><b>Three Wire Compensator System</b>, in which two auxiliary dynamos
A and B called <i>compensators or equalizers</i>, are coupled together and
connected to the system as shown in <a href="#fig0796">fig. 796</a>. Each compensator
generates one-half as much pressure as the main dynamo D, and serves
to equalize the pressure and the load, the compensator on the lightly
loaded side operating as a motor and driving the other as a dynamo.
When the system is exactly balanced, both compensators run as motors
under no load, therefore, consume very little energy. In this arrangement
only one booster E, is required for both sides of the system, as the
compensators are connected to the outside wires at a point beyond the
boosters, and therefore, sub-divide the increased difference of pressure
equally between the two sides of the system.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How is the dynamotor used as an equalizer in
the three wire system?</b></p>

<p>Ans. When thus used, the machine is connected as in <a href="#fig0798">fig. 798</a>.
When both sides of the system are balanced, there will be no
current in the neutral lead N, and a small current will pass
through the two armature windings of the dynamotor in series,
both armatures acting as motors. If the load on one side of the
system become larger than the load on the other side, there will
be a greater drop in the leads connected to the overloaded side
and consequently a lower voltage will exist over the larger load
than exists over the smaller load. The armature winding of the
dynamotor connected to the higher voltage will act as a dynamo,
whose pressure will tend to raise the voltage of the more heavily
loaded side.

<p>When an unbalanced load comes on, the voltage on the lightly
loaded side rises and on the heavily loaded side drops. The
machine on the light side then takes power from the line and runs
as a motor driving the machine on the heavy side as a dynamo,
supplying the extra current for that side. This action tends to
bring the voltage back to normal and gives good regulation.

machines by the conductors A and B to which the motor portions M are connected in
parallel. These motors are provided with shunt wound field coils which may be connected
to the primary or to the secondary circuit, consequently the machines run at a practically
constant speed. The dynamo portions D of the transformers are connected to the secondary
circuits which supply the lamps, etc., L, as indicated. The field magnets of these dynamos
may also be fed by the main circuit AB, or they may be self-excited by shunt or compound
winding. In <a href="#fig0803">fig. 803</a>, the motors M are all connected in series with the main dynamo G,
and the dynamo elements D of the transformers, connected to the lamps, etc., L. If the
current be kept constant (the dynamo G having a regulator like a series arc dynamo),
and the motors M are simple series wound machines, they will exert a certain torque, or
turning effort, which will be constant. It follows, therefore, that if the dynamos D be
also series wound, each will generate a certain current which will be constant. If lamps or
other devices, designed for that particular current, be connected in series on the secondary
circuits, the dynamos D will always maintain that current, no matter how many lamps there
may be. When lamps are added, the resistance of the local circuit is raised, and the current
in it decreases, so that the dynamo increases its speed until it generates sufficient pressure
to produce practically the same current as before. Hence this constitutes a system which
is self-regulating, when lamps, etc., are cut in or out of the secondary circuits. No harm
results even if the secondary be short circuited, since only the normal current can be
generated. But if the secondary circuit be opened, then the machine will race, and probably
injure itself by centrifugal force, because the torque of the motor M has its full value,
and there is no load upon the dynamos D. To guard against this danger, some automatic
device should be provided to short circuit the field or armature of the motor when its speed
or reverse voltage rises above a certain point.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are the coils connected to the dynamo?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Two coils are used and are connected to the collector
rings as shown in <a href="#fig0801">fig. 801</a>, one coil across each phase. The connections
from the middle points of the coils are connected together
and to the neutral wire of the system.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 804.—Diagram to show correctness of balancing coil connection. In the figure, AE,
BF, CG, and DH represent the balance coil and its connection for different positions of
the armature of a bipolar machine.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the action of the coils in equalizing the
load?</b></p>

<p>Ans. On balanced load, the coils take a small alternating
exciting current from the collector rings as any transformer does
when connected to an alternating current line with its secondary
open. When an unbalanced load comes on, the current in the
neutral divides, half going to each coil. This enters the coil at
the middle point and half flows each way through the coil and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_717">717</span>
the slip rings into the armature winding. The unbalanced
current is thus fed back directly into the dynamo armature
continuously.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The coils are small and can be placed back of the switchboard or below
the floor, as they require no attention. The current flowing to each slip
ring is 25% of the direct current in the neutral wire with the small exciting
current taken by the coil added.</p>

<p>The coils are usually built to take care of current in the neutral equal
to 25% of full load current of the dynamo with a voltage regulation not
to exceed 2 per cent.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. Upon what does the operation of the balancing
coil system depend?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It depends on the following points: First, the <i>impedance</i><a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>
of the coils keeps the exciting current which they take from the
collector rings down to a small value as it is alternating current.
At the same time the current from the neutral wire flows through
the four half coils in parallel, and being direct current is impeded
only by the ohmic resistance of the coils, which is low, giving
only a slight loss in the coils. The common point to which the
neutral wire is connected must at all times be neutral to the - and
+ direct current brushes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>That this common point is at all times neutral is readily shown.
Referring to <a href="#fig0804">fig. 804</a>, let AE, BF, CG and DH represent the balance coil
and its connection for different positions of the armature of a bipolar
machine. Let O be the tap to the middle point of the winding.</p>

<p>Take the instant when the balance coil taps are directly under the
direct current brushes as shown at position AE. It is evident that since
the point O is the middle point of the coil, it is neutral between A and E.
When the armature turns so that the balance coils take the position BF,
the voltage drop between A and E may be divided into 4 parts, AB,
BO, OF and FE. As in the first instance, O is neutral between the ends
of the coil, and the voltage drop over OF equals that over OB.</p>

<p>Since the space AB includes the same number of armature coils as
space FE and they are in fields of equal strength, the voltages across the
two spaces will be equal, and the voltage over AB equals that over FE.
Then adding equals: AB + BO = FE + FO and O is neutral
between A and E as in the first case.</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_718">718</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>In the same way it can be shown that O is neutral between the direct
current brushes for any position of the balance coil taps. One coil will
operate the system, but two coils, giving four points spaced 90 electrical
degrees apart, give better distribution of the current to the armature
winding and better regulation of the voltage.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Boosters.</b>—A booster may be defined as, <i>a dynamo inserted
in a circuit at a point when it is necessary to change the voltage</i>.
A booster is generally driven by a motor, the two armatures
being directly coupled, although boosters are sometimes driven
from the engine or line shaft.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 805.—Crocker Wheeler motor-dynamo set. There are numerous cases where such a
combination is useful for furnishing a circuit with a voltage different from that of the main
plant or with a voltage that can be varied independently. For storage battery charging
and electrolytic work, where constant current is desirable, it forms a simple means of
voltage regulation. Where a circuit of special voltage is required, the set not only supplies
current at the desired pressure, but insulates the special circuit, which may be subject to
more severe requirements than the main system. The advantage of the three wire distribution
can be obtained from any two wire dynamo by means of a small rotary balancer
or balancing transformer, which consists of two direct current machines of the same voltage,
mechanically connected together with their armatures in series. Multiple voltage systems
for speed regulation can also be obtained by a similar arrangement.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Explain the use of a booster?</b></p>

<p>Ans. When a number of feeders run out from a station, the
longest and those carrying the heaviest loads will have so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_719">719</span>
drop on the line that the pressure at distant points is too low.
It is therefore necessary to raise the pressure to compensate for
the drop and this is done by inserting a booster in the circuit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It would not be economical to raise the voltage on all the lines by
supplying current from the main dynamo at higher pressure, hence the
voltage is raised only on the lines which need it by means of the booster
working in series with the main dynamo.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII<br />

<small id="WIRES_AND_WIRE_CALCULATION">WIRES AND WIRE CALCULATIONS</small></h2>


<p>The wireman who is called upon to plan and install a system
of wiring will find it necessary first to have a knowledge of the
various kinds of wire so as to select the one best suited for the
work, and to be able to make simple calculations in order to
determine the proper sizes of wire for the various circuits.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wires are generally made of circular cross section. The process of
manufacture consists in drawing the material through steel dies, when
its properties permit this treatment. In the case of some substances,
as for instance, tin and lead, difficulties arise in the drawing process,
and these are therefore "squirted."</p>

<p>The metals most extensively used for wires are copper and iron;
German silver, tin and lead are also employed, but only at points where
it is desirable to have a comparatively high resistance in the circuit.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Copper Wire.</b>—Copper is used in nearly all cases of wiring
because it combines high electrical conductivity with good
mechanical qualities and reasonable price. In conductivity it
is only surpassed by silver, but the cost of the latter of course
prohibits its use for wiring purposes.</p>

<p>Copper wire is used for electric light and power lines, for most
telephone and some telegraph lines, and for all cases where low
resistance is required at moderate cost.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hard drawn copper wire is ductile, and has a high tensile strength;
these properties allow it to be bent around corners and drawn through
tubes without injury.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_722">722</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Pure annealed copper has a specific gravity of 8.89 at 60&deg; Fahr. One
cubic inch weighs .32 pound; its melting point is about 2,100&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>Good hard drawn copper has a tensile strength of about three times
its own weight per mile length. Thus, a number 10 B. &amp; S. gauge
copper wire, weighing 166 lbs. per mile, will have a breaking strength
equal to approximately 3 &times; 166 = 498 lbs.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Iron Wire.</b>—This kind of wire is largely used for telegraph
and telephone lines, although it is rapidly being replaced by
copper in long lines.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>There are three grades of iron wire:</p>

<p>1. <b>Extra best best (E. B. B.)</b> which has the highest conductivity and
is the nearest to being uniform, in quality, being both tough and pliable;</p>

<p>2. <b>Best best (B. B.)</b>, which varies more in quality, is not so tough,
and is lower in conductivity. <i>It is frequently sold as</i> <b>E. B. B.</b>;</p>

<p>3. <b>Best (B.)</b>, which is the poorest grade made, being more brittle, and
lowest in conductivity. Iron wire should be well galvanized.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>German Silver Wire.</b>—German silver is an alloy consisting
of 18 to 30% nickel, and the balance about four parts copper
to one part zinc. It is very largely used as a resistance material
in making resistance coils, and is sold in the form of wire, and
strip. The resistance of this wire varies with its composition.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The resistance of the 18% alloy at 25&deg; C. is 18 times that of copper,
and of the 30% alloy about 28 times that of copper.</p>

<p>The safe carrying capacity of the wire in spirals in open air for continuous
duty is such that the circular mils per ampere varies from about
1,500 in No. 10 wire to about 475 in No. 30. For intermittent duty the
capacity is twice as great.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Standard of Copper Wire Resistance.</b>—Matthiessen's
standard for resistance of copper wire is as follows: <i>A hard
drawn copper wire one meter long, weighing one gramme, has a
resistance of .1469 B. A. unit at 32&deg; Fahr.</i> Relative conducting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_723">723</span>
power: silver, 100; hard or un-annealed copper, 99.95; soft or
annealed copper, 102.21.</p>

<p>A committee of the Am. Inst. Electrical Engineers recommends
the following form of Matthiessen's standard, taking 8.89
as the specific gravity of pure copper: <i>A soft copper wire one
meter long and one millimeter in diameter has an electrical resistance
of .02057 B. A. unit at 0&deg;C.</i><a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> From this the resistance of
a soft copper wire one foot long and .001 in. in diameter (mil-foot)
is 9.72 B. A. units at 0&deg;C.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For every degree Fahr., the resistance of copper wire increases .2222%.
Thus a piece of copper wire having a resistance of 10 ohms at 32&deg;, would
have a resistance of 11.11 ohms at 82&deg;.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Conductors.</b>—Copper is used more than any other metal for
transmitting electrical energy, and for interior wiring it is used
exclusively. Copper conductors should be of the highest commercial
conductivity, not less than 97%.</p>

<p>For conductors up to sizes as large as No. 8 B. &amp; S. gauge,
single conductors may be used, but for larger sizes the necessary
conductivity should be obtained by conductors made up of
strands of smaller wires. The size of these strands depend
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_724">724</span>
upon the size of the conductors and the conditions under which
they are to be used.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Where conductors are very large (as for instance dynamo leads), and
where it is essential that they should be as flexible as possible, strands
as small as No. 20 or 22 B. &amp; S. gauge may be used.</p>

<p>Conductors for flexible cords, pendants, fixtures, etc., should also
consist of very fine strands, so that they may be perfectly pliable and
flexible.</p>

<p>The individual strands for instance, for a No. 16 B. &amp; S. gauge
flexible cord should be as fine as No. 30.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Covered Conductors.</b>—For most conditions of service, wires
are protected with an insulating covering. Wires used in interior
circuits should have a covering which shall act both as an
electrical insulator and as a mechanical protection. In some
instances, however, the insulating qualities are of secondary
importance.</p>

<p>The various forms of covering now in use commercially for
wires are:</p>

<p>

<p><b>Rubber Covered Conductors.</b>—This class of conductor consists
of a tinned copper wire with a rubber covering, protected
by an outside braiding of cotton saturated with a preservative
compound.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the advantages of rubber insulation
for conductors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is waterproof, flexible, fairly strong, and has high
insulating qualities.</p>

<p>Ans. It deteriorates more or less rapidly and is quickly
injured by temperatures above 140&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p><b>Ques. For what service are rubber covered conductors
adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For interior wiring.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Is pure rubber used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. No. The covering should be made from a compound
containing from 20 to 35 per cent. of pure rubber.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It would be difficult to place pure rubber on a wire, and moreover a
covering made of pure rubber would not be durable and would deteriorate
very rapidly, particularly at temperatures above 120&deg; Fahr. Accordingly,
it is mixed with other materials, such as French chalk, silicate
of magnesia, sulphur, red lead, etc.</p></blockquote>

saturated with a moisture resisting insulating compound.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Where are weather proof conductors used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In places subject to dampness, such as cellars, tunnels,
open sheds, breweries, etc.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the advantages of weather proof conductors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The insulation is cheap, very durable, and does not
deteriorate unless exposed to high temperatures such as will
melt the compound.</p>

<p><b>Ques. State the disadvantages.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The covering is more or less inflammable and is not
very efficient as an insulator.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What precaution should be taken in using
weather proof conductors?</b></p>

<p>Ans. On account of the inflammable character of the covering,
care should be taken in wiring at points where any considerable
number of conductors are brought together, or where
there is much woodwork or other combustible material.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_727">727</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. For what use are weather proof conductors
especially adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For outside wiring where moisture is certain and where
fireproof quality is not necessary.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Obviously conductors of this class should not be used in conduits,
nor in fact, in any way except exposed on glass or porcelain insulators.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Slow Burning Wire.</b>—This class of conductor is defined as:
<i>one that will not carry fire</i>. The covering consists of layers of
cotton or other thread, all the interstices of which are filled
with the fireproofing compound, or of material having equivalent
fire resisting and insulating properties. The outer layer
is braided and specially designed to withstand abrasion. The
thickness of insulation must not be less than that required
for slow burning weather proof wire and the outer surface must
be finished smooth and hard.—<i>Underwriters' requirements.</i></p>

<p><b>Ques.  For what service is slow burning weather proof
wire not suited?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is not adapted to outside work.</p>

<p><b>Safe Carrying Capacity of Wire.</b>—All wires will heat
when a current of electricity passes through them. The greater
the current or the smaller the wire, the greater will be the heating
effect. Large wires are heated comparatively more than small
wires because the latter have a relatively greater radiating
surface.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 815.—Pothead wires. The standard wire for pothead work is either No. 19, 20 or 22
B. &amp; S. gauge, either single conductor or twisted pair, insulated to a diameter of <sup>3</sup>/<sub>32</sub> inch
over rubber, without any outer braid or protection. In the case of twisted pairs one
conductor is usually made of a differently colored rubber than the other, so as to distinguish
between them.</p>
</div>

<p>The temperature of a wire increases approximately as the
square of the current, and inversely as the cube of the diameter
of the wire.</p>

<p>The elevation in temperature of a wire carrying a current
represents so much lost energy.</p>

<p>From these considerations it must be clear that it is important
not to overload conductors in order to secure efficient working,
and to avoid risk of fire on inside installations.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The Board of Underwriters specifies that the carrying capacity of a
conductor is safe when the wire will conduct a certain current without
becoming painfully hot.</p>

<p>In the following table of carrying capacity, prepared by the underwriters,
a wire is assumed to have a safe carrying capacity when its
temperature is not increased by the given current over 30&deg; Fahr. above
that of the surrounding air.</p></blockquote>

area in measuring wires. It is equal to the area of a circle .001 in. diameter; its
value is .0000007854 square inch. In the figure the sum of the areas of the nine small
circles equals the area of the large circle. This is evident from the following: Take the
diameter of the small circles as unity, then the diameter of the large circle is three. Hence,
the sum of the area of the small circles &times; (&frac14; π &times; 1<sup>2</sup>) &times; 9 = .7854 &times; 9 = 7.0686; area
of the large circle = &frac14; π &times; 3<sup>2</sup> = .7854 &times; 9 = 7.0686. Therefore since the area of the
large circle equals the sum of the areas of the small circles, the area of a wire in circular

<p>The circular mil (abbreviated C.M.) applies to all <i>round</i> conductors,

as follows: Reduce the fraction <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> to the decimal of an inch, multiply
the result by 1,000 to express the diameter in mils, and square the
diameter so expressed, thus:  <sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> = 1,000 &divide; 3 = .333. .333 &times; 1,000 = 333 mils;

<blockquote>

<p>When no point is specified, the feet are always measured from the

<p>This when divided by the ten 16 c.p. units comprising four 16 c.p. lamps
and three 32 c.p. lamps, gives a little over 28&frac12; feet as the distance from

<p>When the center of distribution is at a considerable distance from the
supply circuit, and it becomes advisable to divide the wiring into two
distinct elements—a feeder and one or more mains, the junction of the
feeder and the mains should be located at the electrical center of the
mains whenever possible. When this is done, it is obvious that the wire
size of only one half the main needs to be calculated, as both halves of
the main are identical.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Wire Gauges.</b>—For the purpose of facilitating the measurement
of wire, a number of gauges have been designed by various
wire manufacturing concerns. The principal gauges used in the
United States are the American or Brown &amp; Sharp's gauge; the
English standard or Birmingham gauge; Washburn &amp; Moen's
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_739">739</span>
standard gauge; Imperial wire gauge; Stubs' steel wire gauge,
and the U. S. Standard wire gauge.</p>

<p>The several gauges are here given with explanation of their
use.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><b>The American Standard or Brown and Sharp's Gauge.</b>—This
gauge is commonly designated as A. W. G. or B. &amp; S., and has been
adopted by brass manufacturers and is used mostly in measuring brass,
copper, silver, German silver, and gold in both wire and plate.</p>

<p><b>Birmingham or Stub's Wire Gauge (B. W. G.).</b>—Old English
Standard and Iron Wire Gauge. <i>Birmingham or Stubs' Iron Wire Gauge
is not the same as Stubs' Steel Wire Gauge</i>. A table of Stub's Steel
Wire Gauge is given on <a href="#Page_741">page 741</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 823.—Micrometer screw gauge. It consists essentially of a screw whose thread is accurately
turned to a pitch of some convenient fraction of an inch or centimetre. When the
screw is screwed home, the surfaces of A and B meet, and the instrument should then
read zero on both the straight and the circular scale. If this be not so, there is a zero
error which must be either allowed for, or corrected by means of the screw provided for
that purpose. If the former course be adopted, the reading of the instrument is taken
when the faces A and B are in contact, and this number added to or subtracted from the
final reading according to whether the error makes the wire apparently smaller or greater
than its real size. The surfaces A and B are now screwed apart and then, after the wire
to be measured (which should be clean and straight) has been introduced between them,
they are screwed together to lightly grip the wire. If the gauge be screwed up too tightly
the value of the measurement is destroyed, since a copper wire can easily be crushed, and
in addition the accurate screw may be permanently damaged. To avoid the possibility
of this happening, screw gauges are provided with a ratchet which prevents an excessive
force being applied to the screw. If the pitch of the screw in the gauge be <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>th of an
inch, and the circular scale consist of 50 divisions, then for each revolution of the screw,
the surface B will travel a distance equal to the pitch, that is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>th of an inch. The graduations
on an instrument of this kind are generally <sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub>th of an inch on the straight scale,
with shorter lines to mark the half divisions. The thickness of a wire on the straight
scale can therefore be read to the nearest <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub>th inch. Each division of the circular scale
represents <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub>th of a revolution of the screw, which corresponds to a change in distance
between A and B, of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>50</sub> of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>20</sub> = <sup>1</sup>/<sub>1,000</sub> in. If then the reading on the straight scale be 1
and on the circular scale 35, the distance between A and B is .1 + .035 = .135 inch.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From the foregoing it is seen that great confusion exists with such a
multiplicity of gauges and emphasizes the importance of specifying the
gauge and of knowing what gauge to use.</p>

<p>In using the gauges known as Stubs' Gauges, there should be constantly
borne in mind the difference between the Stubs' Iron Wire
Gauge and the Stubs' Steel Wire Gauge. The Stubs' Iron Wire Gauge
is the one commonly known as the English Standard Wire, or Birmingham
Gauge and designates the Stubs' <i>soft</i> wire sizes. The Stubs' Steel
Wire Gauge is the one that is used in measuring drawn steel wire or
drill rods of Stubs' make and is also used by many makers of American
drill rods.</p></blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—The sizes of wire are ordinarily expressed by an arbitrary series of numbers.
Unfortunately there are several independent numbering methods, so that it is always necessary
to specify the method or wire gauge used. The above table gives the numbers and diameters in
decimal parts of an inch for the various wire gauges in general use.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Wiring Terms.</b>—The various members of a complex wiring
installation are designated feeders, sub-feeders, mains, branches,
and taps.</p>

<p>A <i>feeder</i> is a stretch of wiring to which no connection is made
except at its two ends.</p>

<p>A <i>sub-feeder</i> is of the same class as a feeder, but is distinguished
either by being one of two or more connecting links
between the end of a single feeder and several distributing
mains, or by constituting an extension of a feeder.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 826.  Circuit diagram illustrating names of the various parts. A circuit may consist of
the following parts as defined in the accompanying text: 1, feeder, 2, sub-feeders, 3, mains,
4, branches, 5, taps. It is well to clearly distinguish between these divisions because
the terms are constantly used in wiring.</p>
</div>

<p>A <i>main</i> is a stretch of wiring supplied from one or more feeders
or sub-feeders and distributing current to a number of taps, or
else to a number of branches.</p>

<p>A <i>branch</i> distributes current among a number of lamps, etc.</p>

<p>A <i>tap</i> almost invariably delivers current to a single lamp or
other device.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_744">744</span></p>

<p>Reference to <a href="#fig0826">fig. 826</a> will make these definitions clearer. This diagram
is intended merely to illustrate the above definitions and does not represent
any special plan of wiring.</p></blockquote>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 827 and 828. Simplest forms of circuit, consisting of a main with one or more lamps at
the end. The smallest size wire allowed (No. 14 B.&amp;S. gauge) will generally be found
amply large for such circuits. Note carefully the difference between a main and a branch
by comparison with <a href="#fig0826">fig. 826</a>. A main begins from a fuse block, while a branch is an offset
from a main without any fuse block.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The simplest possible wiring installation is one in which a single lamp
or compact cluster of lamps is located at the end of a main, as shown in
figs. 827 and 828. In such cases calculations are almost always unnecessary,
for the reason that No. 14 wire, the smallest size allowed by the
underwriters, will supply several lamps at a long distance (as interior
wiring goes) with a very moderate drop. For example, if the three
lamps shown at the end of the main in <a href="#fig0828">fig. 828</a>, be of 16 candle power
each, and the voltage of the supply circuit be 110 volts, a main of No. 14
wire would supply the lamps at a distance of 135 feet from the fuse
block with a drop of only 1 per cent.</p>

<p>When the lamps are strung along the main, however, as in <a href="#fig0826">fig. 826</a>, it
is sometimes necessary to choose the size of wire with regard to the drop,
and in order to do this the main must be measured for either "ampere
feet" or "lamp feet."</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Wire Calculations.</b>—The problem of calculating the size of
wire will be presented here in as simple a form as possible, with
explanation of the various steps so that any one can understand
how the formula is derived.</p>

<p>In determining the size of wire, there are four known factors
which enter into the calculation, viz.:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_745">745</span></p>

<p>
1.  Length of circuit in feet;<br />
2.  Maximum current in amperes;<br />
3.  Drop or volts lost in the circuit, <i>in % of the impressed voltage</i>;<br />
4.  Heating effect of the current.<br />
</p>

<p>The calculation is based on the <i>mil foot</i>, which as previously
explained, is a foot of copper wire one mil in diameter and whose
resistance is equal to 10.79 ohms at 75&deg; Fahr.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig0829" src="images/fig0829.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 829.—Wiring for lights requiring unusually long feeders.</p>
</div>

<p>The first step is to find an expression for the resistance of the
wire which may be later substituted in Ohm's law formula.
Accordingly, the resistance of any conductor is equal to <i>its length
in feet multiplied by its resistance per mil foot and the product
divided by its area in circular mils</i>, thus:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_746">746</span></p>

<p class="table">resistance in ohms = <span class="div">
<span class="num">length in feet &times; resistance per mil foot</span>
<span class="tdc">circular mils</span></span></p>

<h4>or</h4>

<p class="table">ohms = <span class="div">
<span class="num">feet &times; 10.8</span>
<span class="denom">circular mils</span></span>
 . . . . (1)</p>

<p>(calling the resistance per mil foot 10.8 instead of 10.79 to
facilitate calculation).</p>

<p>Now, since the length of the circuit is given as the "run" or
distance one way, that is, one half the total length of wire in
the circuit, formula (3) must be multiplied by 2 to get the total
drop, that is:

equation is obtained for size of wire:</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 830 and 831.—Symmetrical and unsymmetrical distribution. When a main is supplied
by a feeder, the junction of the two, if practicable, is located at the electrical center of
the main, as indicated in <a href="#fig0830">fig. 830</a>, so that the distribution is symmetrical, that is, the
ampere feet each way from the junction are the same. This is nearly always practicable
in surface wiring, and when it is practiced it is only necessary to calculate the wire size
for one-half of the main, as the other half is identical. In <a href="#fig0830">fig. 830</a> there are four lamps
on each side of the junction, J; the center of each group is at a distance, M, so that the
lamp feet in each half of the main are 5 &times; M. The lamp feet of the feeder would be
10 &times; N, N being the distance from the feeder fuse block to the junction, J. In concealed
work, however, it does not always happen that a feeder can be made to join a
main at its electrical center; when this is not practicable, each end of the main should
be figured separately. In <a href="#fig0831">fig. 831</a>, for instance, the main has five lamps on one side and
two on the other, and the distances from the junction to the centers of the two groups
are at unequal distances S and S'. If the distance S be 14 feet, and the lamps, 16 c. p.,
the lamp feet in the left hand main equals 5 &times; 14 = 70, while in the main to the right,
taking S' at 10 feet, there are only 2 &times; 10 = 20 lamp feet. Hence what appears to be
one continuous main in this case would have to be treated as two mains, and each part
figured separately.</p>

<p>The volts lost or drop is equal to 250 &times; .03 = 7.5 volts.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. If the calculated size of wire be larger than any
in the table how is the required area obtained?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By using two or more smaller wires in parallel, whose
combined area is equal to the required area.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To facilitate finding the equivalent sizes the above table of wire
equivalents has been prepared.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_752">752</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How is the table of wire equivalents used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. To use the table, find in the vertical column at left the
size of conductor desired; then follow along horizontally until
the size of wire that is desired to use for the strands, and the
corresponding number at top of column will give the number
of strands of that size wire required.</p>

down fashion with the two outers connected together and the neutral wire serving as one

depends on conditions of operation. Three wire circuits for occasional two wire working,
must have a neutral wire whose cross section is equal to the combined cross sections of
the two outer wires. This plan is useful for buildings supplied from a central station, as
it will be satisfactory for two wire operation in emergencies, and for three wire, two phase
or three phase distribution should the central station ultimately be changed over to
either of those alternating current systems. The expense for the extra copper in the
beginning will not be nearly so great as that entailed by a change in the wiring later on
should developments require it. It is permissible, however, to make the cross section
of the neutral wire smaller than that of each outer wire, if one be reasonably sure that
there will never be any changes such as those just mentioned, and if the drop in the two
outer wires do not exceed 1&frac12; per cent. Under such conditions, it will be found a very
good rule to calculate the neutral wire of a principal feeder for a maximum unbalancing
of 25 per cent, that is, a condition under which the current in one outer wire will be 75
per cent of the current in the other one, the current in the neutral being 25 per cent of

incandescent lamp is rated as equivalent to the light given
by 16 candles, and may consume, according to type and make,
from 50 to 56 watts, or from 3.1 to 3.5 watts per candle power.
Therefore, a 660 watt circuit will carry thirteen 16 candle power

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 834.—Diagram showing symmetrical and unsymmetrical distribution. The two 5 lamp
centers are located at equal distances from the distributing pocket or cabinet, P, so that the
sub-feeders, A and A', have equal values of lamp feet. The sub-feeders, B, B', have
equal lengths, but as one supplies 10 lamps, and the other 16, the lamp feet are different,
and each sub-feeder must therefore be figured separately. The main, G, should be considered
as a part of the sub-feeder, B, in order to avoid the necessity for a fuse at the
junction of the two. As it is symmetrically divided, only one-half of it would be considered.
Thus, if the sub-feeder, B, were 50 feet long, and the main, G, 30 feet long, B
would have 16 &times; 50 = 800 lamp feet and one-half of the main would have 8 &times; 15 = 120
lamp feet (assuming all 16 c. p. lamps). Hence 800 + 120 = 920 lamp feet should be
taken as the load length and the proper size wire used for that figure, making the sub-feeder,
B, of the same size as the main, G. The same procedure applies to the sub-feeder
B' and main G'; also to the sub-feeder, E, and the main, F. The proper sizes of wire
for the different circuits is easily found from the lamp feet table, after having calculated

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 835 and 836.—The "tree" and "modified tree" systems of wiring. The tree system
consists of a feeder reducing in size and supplying mains for each floor, the general
arrangement resembling the trunk and branches of a tree. Since fuses must be inserted
on each floor where the size of the feeder is reduced, the system requires a large number
of joints, and in the event of a fuse blowing it could not be quickly located. The tree
system is not to be recommended, as it results in considerable drop, and at full load the
lamps nearest the point of supply will either burn too brightly or those more remote will
not give the rated candle power. In the modified tree system, <a href="#fig0836">fig. 836</a>, the size of the
feeder is not reduced. With this arrangement the losses are considerably reduced owing
to the much smaller losses on the feeder between those centers farthest away from the
point of supply.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The proper size of wire for a 660 watt circuit will depend upon the
voltage for which the lamps are made. For example: a 16 candle power
lamp which consumes 56 watts on 110 volt circuit will take, 56 &divide; 110 = .5
or &frac12; ampere of current, while the same lamp, if made for 220 volts, will
take only 55 &divide; 220 = .25 or &frac14; ampere. Therefore, eleven 16 candle power
56 watt lamps will require a current of 5&frac12; amperes at 110 volts, or 2&frac34;
amperes at 220 volts.</p>

<p>According to the laws of resistance, the resistance of a round wire is
inversely proportional to the square of the diameter, and if the circuit
be taken at 100 feet, and the allowable percentage of drop at 1 volt,
then according to formula, (5) on <a href="#Page_748">page 748</a>, the wire required for a circuit
carrying eleven 16 candle power 56 watt 110 volt lamps, will have a
cross sectional area of,</p>

<span class="num">5.5 &times; 100 &times; 21.6</span>

gauge, wire must be used for the circuit carrying the 110 volt lamps,
while No. 12, B. &amp; S. wire, would be sufficient for the 220 volt circuit.</p>

<p>In the case shown in <a href="#fig0829">fig. 829</a>, the branch circuits A and B are identical,
each supplying four 16 candle power lamps requiring 3.5 watts
per candle power at 110 volts or carrying a load of 4 &times; 16 &times; 3.5 = 224

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs</span>. 839 and 840.—Wrong and right methods of loop wiring. In general, when a large percentage
of loss is allowed with lamps at short distances, the size of wire, calculated simply in
accordance with the resistance rules, will be found too small to carry the current safely.
This fact is often overlooked, and even though wires may have been correctly calculated
for a uniform percentage of loss, they will become painfully hot simply because the table
of carrying capacity was not consulted. The cross connection of mains wherever possible,
for the purpose of equalizing the pressure, will also often reduce the heating effects of the
current. An example of this is shown in the above figures. A circle of lights was wired
as in <a href="#fig0839">fig. 839</a>, and after the current had been turned on, the wires of the circle became hot,
and there was quite a perceptible difference of candle power between the lights near A
and those near B. Investigation disclosed the fact that the loop, contrary to instructions,
had been left open. A few inches of wire as shown in dotted lines remedied the fault.
A better arrangement, however, is shown in <a href="#fig0840">fig. 840</a>.</p>

<p>To determine the current required for a motor, as for instance, the 10
H. P. motor under consideration, <i>multiply the horsepower by 746, and
divide the product by the voltage of the motor multiplied by its efficiency as
follows</i>: (10 &times; 746) &divide; (220 &times; .90) = 37.6 amperes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_761">761</span></p>

<p>This value increased by 25 per cent. of itself (37.6 &times; .25 = 9.4 amp.) is
equal to 37.6 plus 9.4 = 47 amperes. In the table of carrying capacities
of copper wire (<a href="#Page_731">page 731</a>), 46 amperes is given as the allowable carrying
capacity of No. 6, B. &amp; S. gauge, rubber covered wire; therefore No. 5
wire must be used.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Calculations for Three Wire Circuit.</b>—In all cases of
interior conduit work, and in most cases of inside open work,
the main feeders from a three wire source of supply are installed
on the three wire plan, and the sub-feeders and distributing
mains, on the two wire plan, except where the application of the
method necessitates the use of unwieldy sizes.</p>

<p>In laying out sub-feeders and mains, the total load, under
normal operating conditions, should be divided as nearly as
possible into two equal parts, and one part connected on each
side of the neutral part of the entrance cut out, or the neutral
bus bar of the switch board or panel board in an isolated plant,
thus making the load on each side of the neutral wire of the
feeder as near equal as possible.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Fig. 841 shows a three wire panel board with connection for 12 mains;
those shown in solid lines as A, B, C, etc., being connected between the
neutral wire and the negative wire of the feeder, and those shown by
dotted lines as G, H, I, etc., being connected between the neutral wire
and the positive wire of the feeder. The total load consists of ninety-one
16 candle power lamps, which are so distributed that the positive
wire of the feeder carries the current for 46 lamps, and the negative
wire, 45 lamps, the neutral wire carrying the difference or current for
1 lamp.</p></blockquote>

<p>The proper size of wire for the mains may be calculated as
already explained, but in calculating the outer wires of the
three wire feeder, the neutral wire should be disregarded and the
outer wires connected as a <i>two wire circuit carrying the total load
of 91 lamps at the over all pressure of 220 volts</i>.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_762">762</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>EXAMPLE.—Ninety-one 16 candle power lamps consuming 3.1 watts
per candle power at a pressure of 110 volts, will require a current of</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="div">
<span class="num">16 &times; 3.1 &times; 91</span>

<p>The distance from the entrance cut out to the main or feeder switch
is 200 feet, then for a 2 per cent. drop, or a loss of 110&times;.02=2.2 volts,
the cross sectional area of the wire will be,</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="div">

neutral wire and the positive wire of the feeder.</p>
</div>


<blockquote>

<p>The joint resistance of the lamps on a three wire system, however,
would be four times greater than on a two wire system; consequently
the resistance of the outer wires of the feeder in this case will be four
times greater for the same percentage of loss, and the cross sectional
area of each of the outer wires will be, 80,509&divide;4=20,127 circular mils.
According to the underwriters' rules, this value compels the use of
No. 6 B. &amp; S. gauge wire.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_763">763</span></p>

<p>If the <i>lamp</i> voltage, 110 volts, be used, the two wire formula
(5) given on <a href="#Page_748">page 748</a> must be modified to,</p>

<p class="table">circular mils = <span class="div">
<span class="num">amperes &times; feet &times; 21.6</span>
<span class="denom">drop &times; 4</span></span></p>

<p>but if an <i>over all</i> voltage, (that is, the voltage between the
outer wires), of 220 volts be used, the two wire formula does
not require any modification.</p>

<p>The proper size of wire may also be calculated by means of
the formula</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="div">
<span class="num">drop</span>
<span class="denom">2 &times; distance &times; amperes</span></span>
 = resistance per foot . . . . (1)</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Example.—If in calculating a three wire feeder, the over all
voltage be 220 volts, the drop = 4.4 volts, twice the distance = 400 feet,
and the current = 20.5 amperes, then,</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="div">
<span class="num">4.4 volts</span>
<span class="denom">400 feet &times; 20.5 amperes</span></span>
 = .0005365 ohms per foot.</p>

<p>In the table of the properties of copper wire which gives the resistance
of various sizes of wire, it will be noted that at all of the given temperatures
No. 8 wire has a resistance greater than the value just
calculated, therefore, No. 6 B. &amp; S. gauge wire should be used for the
outer wires of the feeder. In the table the resistance is given per 1,000
feet, hence it is only necessary to move the decimal point to obtain the
resistance per foot.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the calculation be based on the lamp voltage, 110 volts, the
formula (1) must be modified to</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="div">
<span class="num">drop &times; 4</span>
<span class="denom">2 &times; distance &times; amperes</span></span>
 = resistance . . . . (2)</p>

<p>In this case, drop = 2.2 volts, 2 &times; distance = 400 feet, and
current = 41 amperes, then,</p>

<p class="table">
<span class="div">
<span class="num">2.2 volts &times; 4</span>

 = .005364 ohms.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_764">764</span></p>

<p><b>Size of the Neutral Wire.</b>—In three wire circuits, the size of
the neutral wire will depend to a great extent upon operating
conditions. In the case of installations which occasionally have
to be worked as two wire systems, the cross section of the
neutral wire should be equal to the combined cross section of
the two outer wires.</p>

<p>For interior wiring which must pass inspection, the neutral
wire must always be twice the size of one of the outside
wires. However, for general distribution, if it be reasonably
sure that the system will always be worked three wire and that
the drop in the two outer wires does not exceed 1&frac12; per cent.,
the cross section of the neutral wire may be made smaller than
that of one of the outer wires. In such a case the size of the
neutral wire may be calculated for a maximum unbalancing of
25 per cent., when the current in one of the outer wires is 75 per
cent. of the current in the other outer wire.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For instance, suppose that in a balanced system, the total load on
each of the outer wires of a feeder be 211 amperes, and that on account
of certain operating conditions, this load has to be divided unequally so
as to put 242 amperes on one of the outer wires, and 181 amperes on the
other outer wire. In this case the neutral wire will carry 60 amperes,
or 25 per cent. of the current carried by the heavier outer wire.</p>

<p>If the drop in the outer wires exceed 1&frac12; per cent., the cross section
of the neutral wire will have to be equal to or larger than that of each
of the outer wires, otherwise the drop in the neutral wire will exceed
&frac12; volt with an unbalancing of 25 per cent.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII<br />

<small id="INSIDE_WIRING">INSIDE WIRING</small></h2>


<p>The term <i>wiring</i> is commonly understood to mean the methods
employed in laying the conductors used for the transmission and
distribution of electrical energy for lighting, power, and other
purposes. Interior wiring, comprises the various methods of
installing the conductors from the entrance devices in the walls
or other parts of the buildings to the lamps, motors, and other
electrical apparatus within the buildings.</p>

<p>The different methods of interior wiring may be conveniently
grouped into the following general classes:</p>

<p>
1. Open or exposed wiring;<br />
2. Wires run in mouldings;<br />
3. Concealed knob and tube wiring;<br />
4. Rigid conduit wiring;<br />
5. Flexible conduit wiring;<br />
6. Armoured cable wiring.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Open or Exposed Wiring.</b>—This method of wiring possesses
the advantages of being cheap, durable and accessible. It is
used a great deal in factories, mills and buildings where the
unsightly appearance of the wires exposed on the walls or ceilings
is of no consequence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_766">766</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What kinds of wires are suitable for this method
of wiring?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Either rubber covered or slow burning weather proof
wire.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Rubber insulation should always be used where the wire is in a damp
place, such as a cellar, and either weather proof or rubber insulation
may be used to protect it against corrosive vapors.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are the wires installed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are laid on some cornice, wainscoting, beam, or
other architectural feature suitable for the purpose, by means of
porcelain knobs and cleats, as shown in figs. 842 to 844.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_767">767</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Porcelain knobs should preferably be of the two piece type (<a href="#fig0863">fig. 863</a>)
in which the wire is carried between the upper and lower portions rather
than being tied to a one piece knob with a tie wire as in <a href="#fig0860">fig. 860</a>.
Various porcelain knobs and cleats are shown in figs. 860 to 866.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What are the disadvantages of open wiring?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The wiring is not sufficiently protected from moisture,
and the effects of fire which will destroy the insulation of the
wires; it is also liable to mechanical injury.</p>

<a href="#fig0847">fig. 847</a>, a wrapped joint on large wire. Splicing of wires or joining a branch to a main
wire should always be made by twisting the wires together or twisting one wire around the
other, so that the joint will be mechanically strong enough to carry all strain which may
come upon it, without any soldering. The joint should then be carefully tinned and
soldered in order to give good electrical contact and to avoid corrosion along the contact
surface. Where wires are too large to be twisted together, the ends are given a short bend
and the two wires wrapped firmly together with a smaller bare copper wire, after which
the joint is thoroughly tinned and soldered, preferably by pouring hot solder over the joint.
The joint is then insulated by wrapping it with two layers of pure rubber, and three layers
of tape, sufficient to make the insulation thickness equal to that of the wire, after which
the whole joint should be painted with water proof paint.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How far apart should the wires be placed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. When installed in dry places and for pressures below
300 volts, the insulators should separate the wires 2&frac12; inches
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_768">768</span>
from each other and &frac12; inch from the surface along which they
pass. For voltages from 300 to 500, the wires should be separated
four inches from each other and one inch from the surface
along which they pass.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If the wiring be in a damp place, the wires should be at least one inch
from the surface.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ans. One which does not have exposed contact ears,  an

<p><b>Practical Points Relating to Exposed Wiring.</b>—Some of
the principal points which should be remembered in this connection,
together with the methods which may be applied to special
cases, may be briefly stated as follows:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_770">770</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>1. In interior wiring no wires smaller than No. 14 B. &amp; S. gauge should
be used, except as allowed by the underwriters, and no more than 660
watts should be allowed to a circuit.</p>

<p>2. Tie wires should have an insulation equal to that of the conductors
which they secure.</p>

<p>3. In all cases, whether the wires be run on knobs, split insulators, or
cleats, the wires should be supported at intervals of at least 4&frac12; feet,
and if exposed to mechanical injury, the supporters should be placed
at closer intervals.</p>

<p>4. Wires run on bare ceilings of low basements, especially where they
are liable to injury, should be protected by two wooden guard strips
as shown in <a href="#fig0858">fig. 858</a>. The protective strips should be at least ⅞ inch
in thickness and slightly higher than the knobs, insulators, or cleats.
The two circuit wires should not be run closer than 6 inches apart,
and wires run near water tanks must be rubber covered so as to render
them moisture proof.</p>

<p>5. Cleats should be used for the wiring of stores, offices, or buildings
having flat ceilings, provided the wiring is installed in dry locations.</p>

<p>6. When the installation is exposed to dampness or acid fumes such as
those developed in stables, bakeries, etc., the wires should run on
knobs or split insulators, and should be rubber covered.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 855 to 857.—Methods of carrying wires through floors. In passing through floors (or
walls) the wires often come in contact with concealed pipes or other grounded material,
hence the only way they can be properly protected is by making the bushing continuous.
This may consist of continuous porcelain tubes as shown in <a href="#fig0855">fig. 855</a>, or short bushings may
be arranged in iron pipes as in <a href="#fig0856">fig. 856</a>. The method followed in case of an offset in the wall
is shown in <a href="#fig0857">fig. 857</a>. Sometimes the floor can be taken up and an iron conduit, properly
bent, put in place, the wires being reinforced with flexible tubing. Another method is to
attach the wires to insulators; in this case the floor must not be put down until the wiring
has been examined by the inspector.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_771">771</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>7. When wires are run at right angles to beams which are more than
4&frac12; feet apart, a running board should be used and the wires
cleated to it as shown in <a href="#fig0843">fig. 843</a>. It is desirable, however, to avoid
the use of running boards, whenever possible by running the wires
parallel with the beams, thus reducing the cost of insulation.</p>

<p>8. In factories or other buildings of open mill construction, mains of
No. 8 B. &amp; S. gauge or larger wire, where they are not exposed to
injury, may be placed about 6 inches apart and run from timber
to timber, not breaking around, and may be supported at each
timber only.</p></blockquote>

from mechanical injury by boxings at least 6 feet high on each floor.
If floor switches be used, they may be mounted on the front of the

<p><b>Wires Run in Mouldings.</b>—Wooden mouldings are extensively
used in connection with the wiring of stores, factories and
buildings. The advantages of this type of construction are: simplicity,
cheapness, and accessibility, and when the moulding is
run straight and accurately mitred it makes a neat job. Any
class of wooden moulding wiring, however, is not sufficiently
impervious to moisture to render it suitable for use in damp
places, and it is liable to be crushed or punctured. Furthermore,
it is naturally very combustible. These difficulties are overcome
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_774">774</span>
to a certain extent by impregnating the moulding with some
kind of moisture repellant, or by coating it both inside and out
with water proof paint. Hardwood moulding should be used
wherever possible, but soft wood moulding usually conforms
much better to the wall line.</p>

<p>Ans. It is adapted to installations in which the wires have to
be laid after the completion of the buildings.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the moulding usually employed.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is made of hardwood in two pieces, a backing and
cap, so constructed as to thoroughly encase the wire.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It should provide a one-half inch tongue between the conductors
and a solid backing which should not be less than three-eighths of an
inch in thickness under the grooves; it should be able to give suitable
protection from abrasion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_775">775</span></p>

<p>The inside of the moulding and the cap must have at least two coats

show the location of the dead moulding. Sometimes, especially in the wiring of private
houses the use of special moulding is necessary. In such cases the shape and kind of wood
should match that of the finish or trim of the room, and the receptacles should be stained
to match the moulding. When the moulding is run along the walls, the capping may be
made to match the trim or the picture moulding already in place, thus giving an apparently
concealed job. In this kind of work the feeders can be run through the spaces between
the walls, and if flexible tubes such as circular loom or flexiduct be used, no splice box will
be necessary where the system of wiring changes and single braided rubber wire may be
used throughout.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the usual character of moulding work?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Usually, a certain part of the work will be run as concealed,
that is, inside the partitions, the wires being "fished"

<p><b>Practical Points Relating to Wiring in Mouldings.</b>—The
following practical points will be found useful in the satisfactory
execution of any class of wiring with wooden moulding:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_778">778</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. Wooden moulding should never be concealed, and should not be used
in damp places or in buildings subject to acid fumes, such as ice
houses, breweries, or stables, etc.</p>

<p>2. Wooden moulding selected for use should be formed of good straight
stock and free from knots, knot holes and other imperfections. The
saving effected in the lower cost of second hand moulding does not
compensate for the additional cost increase in its working.</p>

<p>3. When wooden moulding is used in connection with solid pipe or
flexible tube conduit, an iron box or conduitlet must be installed
where the system of wiring changes, as shown in <a href="#fig0875">fig. 875</a>. The pipe
conduit is secured to the box by means of lock nuts, with porcelain
bushings or flexible tubes protecting the wires. In all cases the loom
should run up to the moulding.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p><b>Arc Light Wiring.</b>—All wiring for high voltage arc lighting circuits should be done with
rubber covered wire. The wires should be arranged to enter and leave the building through
an approved double contact service switch which should close the main circuit and disconnect
the wires in the building when turned "off" and be so constructed that they will be
automatic in their action, not stopping between points when started and to prevent arcing
between points under any circumstances, and should indicate plainly whether the current is
"on" or "off." Never use snap switches for arc lighting circuits. All arc light wiring of this
class should be in plain sight and never enclosed, except when required, and should be supported
on porcelain or glass insulators which separate the wires at least one inch from the
surface wired over. The wires should be kept rigidly at least eight inches apart, except, of
course, within the lamp, hanger board or cut out box or switch. On side walls, the wiring
should be protected from mechanical injury by a substantial boxing, retaining an air space of
one inch around the conductors, closed at the top (the wires passing through bushed holes)
and extending not less than seven feet from the floor. When crossing floor timbers in cellars
or in rooms, where they are liable to be injured, wires should be attached by their insulating
supports to the under side of a wooden strip not less than one-half an inch in thickness.</p>

<p><b>Arc Lamps on Low Pressure Service.</b>—For this service there should be a cut out for each
lamp or series of lamps. The branch conductors for such lamps should have a carrying capacity
about 50 per cent. in excess of the normal current required by the lamp or lamps to provide
for the extra current required when the lamps are started or should a carbon become stuck
without over fusing the wires. If any resistance coils be necessary for adjustment or regulation,
they should be enclosed in non-combustible material and be treated as sources of heat; it
is preferable that such resistance coils be placed within the metal framework of the lamp itself.
Incandescent lamps should never be used for resistance devices. These lamps should be provided
with globes and spark arresters, as in the case of arc lamps on high voltage series
circuits, except when the closed arc lamps are used.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_779">779</span></p>

<p>4. Wooden moulding should never be run in elevator shafts, or shafts of
any kind, and should never be run on the inner side of the outside walls
of the buildings, as these locations are usually subject to dampness.</p>

<p>5. In laying out feeders it is usually cheaper to use iron conduit in a
shaft, than to run moulding through the floor timbers.</p>

<p>6. When tapping outlets for feeder circuits, an iron outlet box with cover
should be used, as shown in <a href="#fig0886">fig. 886</a>. The one splice box is held up
to the outlet box already installed by means of two long screws, and
the loom is run right up to the moulding so as to leave no exposed wire.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Concealed Knob and Tube Wiring.</b>—This method of wiring
should be discouraged as far as possible, as it is subject to
mechanical injury, is liable to interference from rats, mice, etc.
As the wires run according to this method are liable to sag
against beams, laths, etc., or are likely to be covered by shavings
or other inflammable building material, a fire could easily result
if the wires become overheated or short circuited.</p>

to the beams. If run perpendicular to the beams, holes are bored in the latter and porcelain
tubes with a shoulder at one end, inserted in the holes through which the wires pass. The
knobs should support the wires at least one inch from the surface over which they run, and
should not be spaced further than 4&frac12; feet apart. The wires should be attached with tie
wires having an insulation equal to that of the conductor which it secures to the knob.
The use of split knobs does away with the necessity of using tie wires. The conductors
must be at least 5 inches apart and it is better to support them on separate beams when
possible. Each wire must be encased in a piece of flexible tube at all switches, outlets, etc.,
and this piece of tubing should be sufficiently long to extend from the last insulator and
project at least one inch beyond the outlet.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Concealed knob and tube wiring is still allowed by the Underwriters,
although many vigorous attempts have been made to have it abolished.
Each of these attempts has met with strong opposition from electric
light companies and contractors, especially in small villages and towns
the argument being that it is the cheapest method of wiring, and if
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_781">781</span>
forbidden, many places which are wired according to this method would
not be wired at all, and the use of electricity would therefore be much
restricted, if not entirely dispensed with in such communities. This
argument, however, is only a temporary makeshift obstruction against
progress, and in the near future, no doubt, concealed knob and tube
wiring will be forbidden by the underwriters.</p></blockquote>

tubes, when run at right angles through the beams, or studs as
shown in <a href="#fig0877">fig. 877</a>.

In wiring for switches, flexible tubing must be used on the conductor ends from the last

A pressed steel switch box should be used to encase each flush switch mechanism, even
though it already be encased in porcelain. A ⅞ in. wood cleat or cleats are arranged
to support the switch box. These wooden cleats should not be set out flush with the
outer edges of the studs, but should be set about ⅜ in. back, as illustrated, to allow a

<p>For instance, if it be necessary to make an outlet for the center fixture
in the parlor, a strip of flooring can be removed from the floor above

conduit wire protection can be extended.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Rigid Conduit Wiring.</b>—The installation of wires in conduits
not only affords protection from mechanical injury, but
also reduces the liability of a short circuit or ground on the wires
producing an arc which would set fire to the surrounding material;
the conduit being of sufficient thickness to blow a fuse
before the arc can burn through the conduit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_785">785</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the unlined type of conduit.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It consists of an iron or steel pipe, similar in size, thickness,
and in every other way to gas pipe, except that special
precautions are taken to free it inside from scale or any irregularities;
it is then coated inside with enamel, outside it is sometimes
enameled and sometimes galvanized.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the lined type of conduit.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It usually consists of a plain iron pipe lined with a tube
of paper which has been treated with an asphaltic or similar
compound; this paper tube is cemented or fastened to the inside
of the iron pipe so that it forms practically an integral part of
the same.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the advantages of unlined conduit?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is cheaper, because having no lining a smaller size of
conduit can be used for any given size of conductor; it is also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_786">786</span>
cheaper to install, as it can be bent, threaded, and cut more
readily than the lined conduit. Wires may be more easily
inserted and withdrawn as the inside is smoother than that of
the lined conduit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—Conduits for inside wiring which are subject to inspection, must have an inside
diameter of not less than ⅝ inch. They must be continuous from outlet to outlet or to junction
bores, and must properly enter and be secured to all fittings, and the entire system be
mechanically secured in position. In case of service connections and main wires, this involves
running each conduit continuously into a main cut out cabinet or gutter surrounding the
panel board as the case may be. Conduits must first be installed without the conductors, and
be equipped at every outlet with an approved outlet box or plate. Outlet plates must not
be used where it is practicable to install outlet bores. The outlet box or plate must be so
installed that it will be flush with the finished surface, and if this surface be broken, it shall be
repaired so that it will not show any gaps or open spaces around the edge of the outlet box or
plate. In buildings already constructed where the conditions are such that neither outlet box
nor plate can be installed, these appliances may be omitted by special permission, providing
the conduit ends are bushed and secured. It is suggested that outlet boxes and fittings having
conductive coatings be used in order to secure better electrical contact at all points throughout
the conduit system. Metal conduits where they enter junction boxes, and at all other outlets,
etc., must be provided with <i>approved</i> bushings or fastening plates, fitted so as to protect wire
from abrasion, except when such protection is obtained by the use of <i>approved</i> nipples, properly
fitted in boxes or devices. Conduits must have the metal of the conduit permanently and
effectually grounded. Conduits and gas pipes must be securely fastened in metal outlet boxes
so as to secure good electrical connections. If conduit, couplings, outlet boxes or fittings
having protective coating of insulating material, such as enamel, be used, such coating must
be thoroughly removed from threads of both couplings and conduit and from surfaces of boxes
and fittings where the conduit is secured in order to obtain requisite good connection. Where
boxes used for centers of distribution do not afford good electrical connection, the conduits
must be joined around them by suitable bond wires. Where sections of metal conduit are
installed without being fastened to the metal structure of buildings or grounded metal piping,
they must be bonded together and joined to a permanent and efficient ground connection.
Junction boxes must always be installed in such a manner as to be accessible. All elbows or
bends must be so made that the conduit or lining of same will not be injured. The radius of
the curve of the inner edge of any elbow must not be less than three and one-half inches.
Must have not more than the equivalent of four quarter bends from outlet to outlet, the
bends at the outlets not being counted.</p></blockquote>

Outlet or junction boxes are of two general types: 1, those which are made for a particular

outlets which are plugged with metal discs in such a manner that the latter can be knocked
out by a slight blow of a hammer. The illustration shows a universal plugged steel conduit
box, which can be used as a straight electric, or combination gas and electric, ceiling or
side wall outlet, or for flush rotary or push button switches, or for flush receptacles. When
rigid conduits are used, they are screwed to the outlets by means of lock nuts and washers.
In the case of flexible conduits, the entering ends of the conduits are provided with clamp
bushings which are secured to the outlet by means of lock nuts. All outlet boxes are fitted
with covers of various designs, which permit their use for various types of construction
such as ceiling and wall work in lath or plaster, fireproofing ceiling work, etc., while many
designs of outlet plates and receptacle plates may be obtained from the supply houses to
satisfy the requirement of any special case.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What are the disadvantages of the unlined
conduit?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The Underwriters require the use of double braided
conductors instead of single braided which are allowed for lined
conduits.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_787">787</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Where may unlined conduits be used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In buildings where the conduit is not liable to corrosive
action.</p>

<p><b>Flexible Conduit Wiring.</b>—Flexible conduits are used to
advantage in many cases where rigid conduits would not be
desirable. It is especially adapted to completed buildings where
it is desired to install the wiring by "fishing" without greatly
disturbing the walls, floors, or ceilings.</p>

strip type (<a href="#fig0891">fig. 891</a>) is constructed of a concave and convex steel strip, spirally wound
upon each other in such a manner as to interlock their concave surfaces. Thus the convex
surfaces of the two strips form respectively the outer and inner surfaces of the conduit.
This construction insures a smooth interior surface, thus reducing the possibility of friction
in the drawing in of conductors. A gasket is provided between the inner and outer strips
rendering the conduit moisture proof. This form of flexible conduit is especially adapted
to use where the wiring is installed after completion of building, because it is very flexible.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How is a flexible conduit installed by "fishing"?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is "fished" under floors, in partitions between the
floor and ceiling, by making pockets in the floors, walls or
ceilings, say every 15 or 20 feet, and fishing through first a stiff
metal wire called a "snake," and then attaching the conduit
to same and pulling the conduit in place from pocket to pocket.

through the plastering at the required position, being careful that there is no studding
at that place. Use a brad awl and cut the hole large enough to permit running of the
wires. With a short length of small brass spring wire, push through the opening a few
inches of number 19 double jack chain such as is used for general fishing purposes, first
having connected the end of the chain with a piece of heavy linen thread. Run out
the thread between the laths and the outside wall until the chain touches the floor beneath;
move the thread and locate the chain by the sound; bore a hole through the baseboard
or floor, as the case may be, toward the chain. Use a two or three foot German
twist gimlet. With a small brass spring wire bent at the end in the shape of a hook, fish
for the chain and draw it out. At the other end of the thread attach the wire and draw
it through with the thread. Passing under the floor bore a second hole through the
floor as near the other as possible. Run into this a piece of snake or fishing wire with a
hook at the end, until it comes to an obstruction. Locate the obstruction by sound. In
running wires under the flooring first carefully examine all parts and find the direction
in which the beams and timbers run, and run the wires parallel with these. After locating
the end of the fishing wire see if the obstruction be a timber; if so, find the center and
bore from the middle diagonally through it in the direction of the fishing wire. Drop
the jack chain and thread through the hole; fish for it and draw it through hole number
2; attach the insulated wire and draw it back. Starting hole number 3, bore hole number
4 diagonally through the timber in the direction in which the wire is to be run, making
holes 3 and 4 form an inverted "V" through the timber. Run the fishing wire through
hole number 4 until it meets an obstruction. If at the end of the room, bore through the
floor, drop the chain, fish it out, attach wire and draw it home. Putty up holes after
having finished the work, in case of hard finish, plug them up with wood. In lightly
built houses it is often found easier to take off the moulding above the baseboard and
run the wire under it. In such cases care should be taken to break off the old nails, as
any attempt to drive them out would cause a bad break. In closets and around chimneys
it is usually found easy to work. A "mouse" or lead weight attached to a string may
often be dropped from the attic to the cellar ceiling through the space outside the chimney.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the difference between flexible conduit
and flexible tubing?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Flexible conduits are made of metal while flexible tubing
is non-metallic.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_790">790</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a flexible conduit.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is a continuous flexible steel tube composed of convex
and concave metal strips, wound spirally upon each other in
such a way as to interlock their concave surfaces.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the advantages of this form of flexible
conduit?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It possesses considerable strength and can be obtained
in long lengths (50 to 200 feet); elbow fittings are not required
as the conduit may be bent to almost any radius. The fissures
of the conduit provide some ventilation; this is an advantage in
some places and a disadvantage in others.</p>

<p><b>Practical Points Relating to Inside Conduit Wiring.</b>—The
following instructions apply to the installation of wiring in
both rigid and flexible conduit:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. All conduits should be made continuous from one junction or outlet
box to another, or to the various fixtures. A conduit installation is
made a complete system by the use of outlets, outlet boxes, switch or
junction boxes, and panel boxes with doors and locks, which serve to
thoroughly protect the circuit at all points.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 898 to 901.—Pull boxes and their use in conduit work. A pull box is a convenient device
used for the purpose of avoiding the disadvantages of having too many bends in one continuous
line of conduit; too many bends will give trouble when the conductors are drawn
in. Pull boxes are also useful in places where the arrangement of the conduit is such that
trouble would be experienced in bending it to a fit, and also in the case of conduits which
are first run on a side wall and then have to be carried across the ceiling at right angles to
the wall. Fig. 898 shows an example of objectionable bends, and <a href="#fig0899">fig. 899</a>, the method of
overcoming the difficulty by the use of a pull box. It is evident that it would be impossible
to make some of these bends so as to permit the drawing in of the conductors. This
difficulty is overcome, as shown, by placing a pull box on the wall, with its top close to the
ceiling. A board B, having the proper size holes for the conduits is fastened to the front
of the box and close to the ceiling. After the conductors have been drawn into the conduits
along the wall as far as the pull box, they can be readily pulled away from the box through
the holes in the board into the corresponding conduit on the ceiling. Fig. 901, shows the
use of a pull box in a case where it is necessary to run conduit through partitions at right
angles to each other. Pull boxes can be designed to suit any condition liable to occur in
practice, and when properly used will always save much time and labor. Locknuts should
be placed on the ends of all conduits, both inside and outside the pull box in order to
prevent their being displaced when drawing in the conductors. After all the conductors
have been drawn into the conduit, all the outlets should be plugged up with wood or fibre
plugs made in parts to fit around the wires and cables, and the outlets given a coating of
some compound which will render the whole system air tight and moisture proof. A final
test should then be made to ascertain that there are no grounds on the different parts of
the wiring, and that the insulation comes up to the requirements of the underwriters. The
metal of all conduits, and the sheathing of steel armoured cables should be effectually and
permanently grounded.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_792">792</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>2. In the installation of interior conduit wiring, the tubes are usually
put in place as soon as the partitions of the buildings have been constructed.
In non-fireproof buildings, the tubes are usually supported
from the underside of the floor beams, but in fireproof buildings they
are placed on top of the floor beams and under the floor as in <a href="#fig0902">fig. 902</a>.</p>

<p>3. When conduit is used in damp places, lead encased wires should be
used, and the wires drawn in very carefully so as to prevent any
injury to the casings.</p>

<p>4. For wiring installations in buildings constructed entirely of reinforced
concrete, the preliminary work should be laid out during the progress
of the building operations so as to avoid, as much as possible, the
necessity of drilling holes in the finished concrete work.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 902.—Method of installing conduits in fire proof buildings. The installation of the conduit
includes the placing of all outlet boxes, and when this has been completed, the lathing or
plastering work is executed, and after that is finished, the wire is pulled into the tubes,
and the receptacles, switches, etc., put in position. The work of pulling in the wires may
be greatly facilitated by the use of <i>pull boxes</i> as shown in <a href="#fig0899">figs. 899</a> and <a href="#fig0901">901</a>.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>5.  For concealed wiring, the location of all the outlets should be marked
by sheet iron tubes large enough to hold the conduits. These tubes
should be properly plugged, and set in the false work before the concrete
is poured in. In a similar manner, threaded pieces of conduit
of the proper size, should be placed in the false work for risers.</p>

<p>6.  For exposed wiring on concrete walls and ceilings, suitable cast iron
supports should be set in the moulds at regular intervals. When
liberally used, these supports will also serve as good supports for
other pipes.</p>

<p>7.  Where a conduit line terminates on the outside of a building some
suitable fitting such as a pipe cap should be used, as shown in <a href="#fig0903">fig. 903</a>,
to prevent the entrance of moisture into the conduit system. A
variety of devices suitable for this purpose are available at supply
houses; but those having porcelain covers which spread the wires the
proper distance apart are the most satisfactory.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_793">793</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>8. Where it is desirable or necessary to continue open wiring from conduits,
or where the character of the wiring makes it necessary to
bring the wires over from the conduit, as in an arc lamp, neat and
safe work can be done by use of a suitable form of <i>condulet</i> as shown

<blockquote>

<p>9. Where a conduit line terminates in a switch or panel box, the lining
or casing of the panels should be of iron, and the conduit firmly
secured to it so as to make good electrical contact. Vertical lines of
conduit should be fastened to the wall or other supports in such a
manner as to prevent the weight of the conduit coming on the
panel box, and each length of conduit installed should be fastened so
as to bear only its own weight. The best method of fastening conduit
to brick walls is by the use of expansion bolts and screws. In
the case of fire brick ceilings or other plastered walls, toggle bolts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_794">794</span>
should be used.   When conduits are run on wooden or iron beams,
various kinds of pipe hanger may be employed.</p>

<p>10. There are numerous devices on the market for bending conduit for the
making of elbows, offsets, etc., but the majority possess the disadvantage
that the conduit must be taken to them to be bent. In the
case of the smaller sizes, this difficulty is avoided by the use of some
form of conduit bender such as shown in figs. 910 and 911.</p></blockquote>

<p>11. In all cases, the interior diameter of the conduit installed should be
amply sufficient to permit of the wires being drawn in easily, thus
providing a substantial raceway for the conductors. The practice of
pulling wires through conduit by means of a block and tackle is very
objectionable. It is evident that if the wires be pulled in by the
application of much force the insulation is very liable to become
damaged; furthermore, much difficulty will be experienced in pulling
them out again, especially in warm places where the heat tends to
soften the lining of the conduit, and also the rubber covering of the
wire. Powdered soapstone put in the pipe while the wires are being
drawn in will lessen the friction and permit the wire to go in more
readily.</p></blockquote>

casing. Armoured cable is manufactured in long lengths, the
actual lengths being determined by convenience in handling.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the features of armoured cable?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is flexible and the conductors are well protected from
mechanical injury. While this form of wiring has not the advantage
of the conduit system—namely, that the wires can be
withdrawn and new wires inserted without disturbing the building
in any way whatever—yet it has many of the advantages of
the flexible steel conduit, and it has some additional advantages
of its own. For example, in a building already erected, this
cable can be fished between the floors and in the partition walls,
where it would be impossible to install either rigid conduit or

To protect the insulation against any possible injury while the wire is being drawn in, a
soft metal bushing should be inserted in the end of the tube and secured permanently
thereto by means of the bushing tool. The bushing provided for this purpose has an outside
thread, which permits its being screwed into the end of the tube and then expanded

</div>

<p><b>Ques. How should armoured cable be installed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It should be continuous from outlet to outlet, without
being spliced and installed on the loop system. Outlet boxes
should be installed at all outlets, although, where this is impossible,
outlet plates may be used under certain conditions.
Clamps should be provided at all outlets, switch boxes, junction
boxes, etc., to hold the cable in place, and also to serve as a
means of grounding the steel sheathing.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Is armoured cable wiring expensive?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is less expensive than the rigid conduit or the flexible
steel conduit, but more expensive than cleat wiring or knob and
tube wiring, and is strongly recommended in preference to the latter.

<h2>CHAPTER  XXXIX<br />

<small id="OUTSIDE_WIRING">OUTSIDE WIRING</small></h2>


<p>In the equipment of lighting and power plants, the cost of the
outside wiring represents a considerable proportion of the total
investment, sometimes costing more than the engines, boilers
and dynamos.</p>

<p>A thorough knowledge of outside wiring is therefore necessary
to properly proportion and install the wires so that the system
will prove economical and safe.</p>

<p><b>Materials for Outside Conductors.</b>—Copper wire is now
considered to be the most suitable material not only for the
transmission of current for electric light and power purposes,
but also for telegraph and telephone lines, in place of the iron
wire formerly employed.</p>

<p>Hard drawn copper wire is used in outside construction,
because its tensile strength ranges from 60,000 to 70,000
pounds or about twice that of soft copper. This is desirable
to withstand the stresses to which the wire is subjected which,
in the case of long spans, are considerable.</p>

<p>The table on the next page gives the tensile strength, in
pounds per square inch of cross section, hard drawn copper
wire of various sizes B. &amp; S. gauge.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_800">800</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The metal <i>aluminum</i> possesses certain advantages as a material for
overhead wires. Its conductivity is about .6 that of copper. The
specific gravity of aluminum is about 2.7, while that of copper is 8.89,
so that a given volume of copper will weigh 3.3 times more than an equal
volume of aluminum, and copper wire of given length and resistance
would be about twice as heavy as an aluminum wire of equal length and
resistance.</p>

<p>There are several disadvantages, such as, low tensile strength, high
electro-positive quality of the metal, higher electrostatic capacity, etc.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Pole Lines.</b>—In the majority of cases overhead conductors
are supported by wooden poles. In tropical countries, however,
such as India, Central America, etc., where wood is rapidly
destroyed by the ravages of white ants and other insects, iron
poles are almost exclusively used for telegraph, telephone, and
other electric transmission lines. The form of iron pole generally
adopted consists of tapering shells of sheet iron of convenient
length, riveted together at their ends and set into cast
iron base plates which are buried in the ground.

<p><b>Wooden Poles.</b>—On account of their size and straightness,
various species of northern pine, cedar and cypress are especially
suitable for large poles. Chestnut, which can be readily sawed
and hewed is a very good material for smaller poles. Sawed
redwood is extensively used in California.</p>

<p><b>Preservation of Wooden Poles.</b>—The preservation of
wooden poles employed in line work is a matter of importance.
Decay of the pole at or near the soil line is caused primarily by
various forms of bacteria or fungi, and in some cases by insects.
Bacteria and fungi attack either dead or living timber. In the
case of dead timber, such as that of poles, they attack the walls
of the cells and cause the familiar rot or decay which eventually
destroys the usefulness of the pole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is well known that the rapid multiplication or action of the bacteria
and the growth of the fungi are induced by a certain per cent. of moisture
and the heat of the sun, that is, the portion of the pole at or near the
soil line is alternately moistened and dried. Therefore, in order to
protect it against this action, it is necessary to sterilize the pole by the
application of an antiseptic which will penetrate the pores of the wood.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Preservation Processes.</b>—There are several processes which
may be successfully employed for the preservation of poles or
other exposed timber. The best known of these are the creosoting,
burnettizing, kyanizing, carbolizing, and vulcanizing processes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In England, creosoted poles showed no sign of decay at the end of
35 years of service. In the United States they have an average life of
22 years. In Europe impregnation with copper sulphate has been
extensively used, but this impregnation must take place within a few
days after cutting down the tree.</p>

<p>Uniformly good results have been obtained by impregnation with
corrosive sublimate, involving simply immersion in the liquid from ten
to fourteen days. German authorities state that the average life of such
poles is about 17 years, compared with 14 years for natural or untreated
poles.</p>

<p>The application of pitch and tar oftentimes results in more harm than
good. It is authoritatively stated, however, that in Europe wooden
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_803">803</span>
poles are effectively protected by painting them with tar up to about
2 feet above, and down to about 1&frac12; feet below the soil line. The painted
parts of the pole are then covered with a cloth which after being nailed
to the pole, is also painted with tar. Finally a zinc plated sheet of iron
painted on both sides with tar, is placed around the cloth and tightened
to the pole.</p>

<p>The saving due to the use of sterilized poles is 40 per cent. of the cost
of unsterilized poles. The comparison is made on the following basis:
Cost of pole, $5 each; sterilizing, $1.25; renewal of sterilized pole in
24 years, unsterilized pole, in 12 years.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Methods of Setting Wooden Poles in Unsuitable Soil.</b>—In
places where salt is plentiful and cheap, such as the Great Salt
Lake region in Utah, it has been found that the liberal use of
salt mixed with the dirt filling tamped in around the foot of the
pole is very effectual in preventing decay below the soil line.</p>

<p>Where poles have to be planted in low, swampy ground, or
where the climatic conditions are such that timber decays rapidly,
it has been found advantageous to place the poles in concrete
settings. This method is extensively employed in various
parts of the Southern States, square poles being placed in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_804">804</span>
settings about 7 feet deep and 3&frac12; feet square. In very soft
ground the employment of a concrete setting is sometimes impracticable.
In such cases piles are driven deep into the soil, and the
pole bolted to the part of the pile extending above the ground.</p>

<p><b>Reinforced Concrete Poles.</b>—The strongest point in favor
of concrete poles is their durability. Untreated wooden telephone
and telegraph poles have to be replaced by new poles
about every six or seven years, depending on the percentage of
moisture in the soil, the drier the soil, the longer being the life
of the pole. Concrete poles are not affected by soil conditions,
and if properly made will last indefinitely.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>One form of reinforced concrete pole consists of a skeleton frame work
of four corrugated iron rods covered with ordinary concrete. The pole
is octagonal in shape, 30 feet long, and provided with mortises for cross
arms, the latter being fastened in place by means of iron bolts. It is
stated that they are less expensive than pine poles, and that each pole
can be manufactured at the point on the line at which it is to be installed
or planted.</p>

<p>In Canada, reinforced concrete poles are made square on account of
the ease of making, and also on account of the steel economy permitted
thereby. All poles are made at the point of erection. They are moulded
in wooden forms, in a horizontal position, the top side being left open
and finished with a trowel. The concrete is composed of one part of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_805">805</span>
Portland cement, two parts clean sharp sand, and four parts broken
stone. A 35 foot pole for ordinary line work weighs about 2&frac12; tons
and a 50 foot pole about 5 tons.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Cross Arms.</b>—The familiar cross arms for stringing wires are
usually attached to the poles before they are erected. They are
commonly made from yellow pine wood, generally 3&frac14; x 4&frac14;
inches, and are freely coated with good mineral paint as a preservative.
Attachment is made to the pole by cutting a <i>gain</i>
one inch deep and of sufficient breadth to allow the longest side
of the cross arm to fit accurately. It is then secured in place
by a lag screw, with a square head, so that it may be driven
into place with a wrench.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 936.—Cross arm which carries the insulator pins. The standard cross arm is 3&frac14; x 4&frac14;

arms are 2&frac34; x 3&frac34; inch, bored for 1&frac14; inch pins and two &frac12; inch bolts.</p>
</div>

<p>The cross arm is further secured to the pole with braces.
These are flat strips of wrought iron or low carbon steel, 30
inches long, &frac14; inch thick and 1&frac14; inches wide, according to
standard specifications. Holes are bored at points one inch
from either end, one for attaching to the pole, the other for
attaching to the cross arm; two braces forming a triangle with
the cross arm for the base and with the apex at the point of
connection to the pole. Like all other iron work used on pole
lines, the braces are carefully "galvanized," so as to stand three
immersions of one minute each in a saturated solution of copper
sulphate without showing copper deposits, the color being black
at the completion of the test.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_806">806</span></p>

<p>Before the cross arm is set in place the gain is carefully painted
with white lead. As it is important that cross arms on a line of
poles, particularly when there are several on each pole, should be
at equal distances from the ground as well as being uniformly
spaced, it is necessary that some measuring instrument should
be used to accomplish this. Such an instrument is the ordinary
<i>template</i>, which is a length of board carrying a pointed block at
one end, to correspond exactly with the top of the pole, and
also cross cleats nailed at precisely the same intervals below it
as it is proposed attaching the cross arms. The template, laid
upon a pole, shows where to cut the gains.</p>

<p>In planting the poles it is customary to so arrange them that
the cross arms on alternate poles shall face in opposite directions,
for the purpose of equalizing the strain on the line. On
curves, however, all cross arms are placed on the side of the pole
facing the middle of the curve.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What provision is made for attachment of the
wires?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The cross arms are bored with holes for the insertion of
the insulator pins, which are made of locust wood and threaded
at the upper end to receive the glass insulator.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The cross arm is made of such a length as to accommodate the number
of pins to be inserted. An arm for two pins is made three feet long,
according to the standard usually followed, with holes for the pins at
center points three inches from either end and a space of 28 inches between
them in the center.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How must electric light and power wires be
placed when wired on telephone or telegraph poles?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They must not be put on the same cross arm with the
telegraph, telephone, or similar wires, and when placed on the
same pole with such wires the distance between the two inside
pins of each cross arm must not be less than twenty-six inches.

<blockquote>

<p><b>Poles for Light and Power Wires.</b>—In selecting the style of pole necessary for a certain
class of work, the conditions and circumstances should be considered. Poles may be divided
into three classes, the size of wire to be carried being one of the important considerations.</p>

<p><i>First Class.</i>—Main line of poles should range in length of from 30 to 35 feet with 6 inch tops.
The height of trees, of course will have to be considered in many cases.</p>

<p><i>Second Class.</i>—Town lighting by arc lights. All poles should have at least 6 inch tops.
The corner poles should have 6&frac12; inch tops, and wherever the cross arms are placed on a pole at
different angles, the pole should have at least a 6&frac12; inch top. A 30 foot pole is sufficiently long
for the main line, but it would be advisable to place 35 foot poles on corners.</p>

<p><i>Third Class.</i>—Where heavy wire, such as No. 00, is used for feeder wire, the poles should
have at least 7 inch tops. Where mains are run on the same pole line the strain is somewhat
lessened, and poles of smaller size will answer.</p>

<p><i>Cull Poles.</i>—All poles that are smaller at the top than the sizes agreed upon, are troubled
with dry rot, large knots and bumps, have more than one bend, or have a sweep of over twelve
inches, should certainly be classed as cull poles. Specifications for electric light and power
work should be, and in many cases are, much more severe than those required by telegraph lines.
A cull pole, one of good material, is the best thing for a guy stub, and is frequently used for this
purpose. A cedar pole is always preferable to any other, owing to the fact that it is very
light in comparison to other timber, and is strong, durable, and very long lived.</p>

<p><i>Pole Setting.</i>—In erecting poles, it seems to be the universal opinion of the best posted
construction men that a pole should be set at least five feet in the ground, and six inches additional
for every five feet additional length above thirty-five feet; also additional depths on
corners. Wherever there is much moisture in the ground, it is of much value to paint or
smear the butt ends of the pole with pitch or tar, allowing this to extend about two feet above
the level of the ground. This protects the pole from rot at the base. The weakest part of the
pole is just where it enters the ground. Never set poles further than 125 feet apart; 110
feet is good practice.</p>

<p><i>Painting.</i>—When poles are to be painted, a dark olive green color should be chosen, in
order that they may be as inconspicuous as possible. One coat of paint should be applied
before pole is set, and one after pole is set. Tops should be pointed to shed water.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_808">808</span></p>

<p><b>Spacing the Poles.</b>—In general, the spacing of poles, like
their dimensions, is regulated by the weight of the lines they
are designed to carry—the heavier the lines the greater the
number of poles. The spacing of poles also depends on their
liability to injury from storms and wind in any given locality,
and the nature of the service. Poles for a telephone line may
be spaced twenty to fifty to the mile—that is, from about
260 to 100 feet apart.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Erecting the Poles.</b>—Since each pole on a properly constructed
line is sawed to the right length and carefully shaped
before it is finally inserted in the ground, it is necessary that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_809">809</span>
the holes be dug to as nearly the required depth as possible.
Holes for poles are dug very little wider than their diameter at
the butt, and the depth is usually computed according to the
nature of the soil and the weight of the proposed line. Excavation,
while sometimes accomplished with patent post hole augers,
or even dynamite, is usually done with a long handled digging
shovel, and the earth removed with a spoon shovel, such as is
shown in <a href="#fig0921">fig. 921</a>.</p>

<p>Wherever required by the nature of the soil, a "grouting" or

and, in marshy or springy ground, a base of concrete and cement
is laid, with filling of the same material around the pole, when
raised.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are the poles transported to the holes?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are rolled or carried on hooks similar to those

prevent crumbling of the earth as the pole is slid into place.
The end is raised by hand sufficiently to allow the "dead man,"
or pole hoist, to be placed beneath, and this is moved along
regularly as the pole is lifted with pike poles, until it slides

<p><b>Guys for Poles.</b>—Where poles are subject to severe strains
which might throw them down and break the wires, guy cables
are largely employed, these being attached near the top and
secured either to the base of the next pole, to a suitable guy
stub or post, or to a guy anchor, which is buried about eight feet
in the earth and held down by stones and concrete.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_812">812</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Under what conditions is it necessary to guy
poles?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are guyed at corners in order to thoroughly secure
the poles so that no strain may come on the cornerwise span.
It is also necessary to guy a line where it is to be deflected from
a straight path, as when rounding a hill, water course or railway
curve, in order to neutralize the pull of the wires, tending
to incline the poles toward the center on which the arc is
described; also when descending a hill.</p>

<p><b>Wiring the Line.</b>—The erection and guying of the poles of a
line as well as the attachment of the cross arms and the screwing
on of the insulators are completed before the stringing of the
line is begun. It is particularly essential that the pull on poles
of a given line be accurately calculated, and that each one be
guyed accordingly before the line is strung, in order to avoid
the danger of an undue strain upon the wires in attempting to
rectify the condition afterward. It is a good working rule that
the wires should be subjected to no stress other than the weights
of their own spans after they have been attached to the poles.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. Describe how the wires are strung.</b></p>

<p>Ans. In stringing the lines, either one or the full number of
wires may be put up at the same time. When one line only is
to be strung, the operation consists simply in reeling the wire
and running it off from a hand reel, such as is shown in <a href="#fig0953">fig. 953</a>
or <a href="#fig0954">954</a>. At each pole the wire is drawn up to its place, pulled
out to the desired tension, and attached to the insulator.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the operation of stringing a number of lines at once, the method is
different. The reels are placed at the beginning of a section, each wire
being inserted and secured through a separate hole in a board, which is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_815">815</span>
perforated to correspond with the spacing of the insulators on the cross
arms. A rope is then attached to this running board, which is drawn by
a team of horses through the stretch to be wired, being lifted over each
pole top in turn. When a certain length has thus been drawn out the
wires are drawn to the required tension between each pair of poles and
secured to the insulators.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. How much tension must be put upon the wires?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In applying tension to the wires as they are strung on
the poles, it is the rule to allow some sag. The amount of sag
to be allowed varies with different line hangers.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_816">816</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>A typical case quoted by one or two authorities gives a sag of four
inches at the center of each 130 foot span for a given size of wire, at a
given temperature. A more general rule is to make the tension on a wire
as it is drawn up between each pair of poles equal to one-third of its
breaking weight. Thus No. 10 B.&amp; S. gauge, would be drawn to about
163 pounds, and No. 12 to about 102 pounds. The temperature at the
time of stringing and the distance between the poles are, however,
important considerations in applying tension and allowing for sag.
Thus, one construction company specifies a dip of 10 inches in summer
and 8 inches in winter for spans of 130 feet, or 40 poles to the mile.
Several authorities specify figures about as given in the above table
for No. 14 iron or copper wire.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How is the wire drawn out?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In drawing out the wire, it is customary to use a wire
clamp, or "come along." This tool is attached to a block and
tackle, or drawn in by hand, and, as soon as the proper force
has been applied, the wire is held, while the lineman secures it
to the insulator.</p>

Standard rules specify that all wires shall be tied to the side of
the insulators toward the pole, except on the insulators next to
the pole, where they are to be attached on the opposite side.
On curves, however, it is required that all wires shall be arranged
so that the strain shall be against the insulator and not on the
wire.</p>

<p><b>Transpositions.</b>—In some classes of circuit, as for instance
telephone lines, the current is often seriously affected by electrostatic
induction from other lines, and also from power circuits,
owing to the fact that the surfaces of the wires form, as it were,
so many charging plates of an electrical condenser, with the
intervening air as the insulating layer or dielectric.</p>

insulators</i>, which are either double insulators, one being screwed to the pin above
the other, or else such caps as are shown in <a href="#fig0967">fig. 967</a>. Such insulators are intended to act
as circuit breakers, the particular wire to be transposed being cut and "dead ended," or
tied around, on both the upper and lower grooves of the cap. The free end of each length
is then passed back and around the insulator and twisted, or sleeve jointed to the other
limb of its own circuit.</p>
</div>

<p>The telephonic current changes the pressure of its own charging
surface as frequently as it alternates, and this fact in itself is
amply sufficient to account for a vast weakening of the current
before it reaches its destination. The only practicable method
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_820">820</span>
of overcoming this annoyance in pole lines is by the arrangement
known as "transposition," which is, briefly, <i>the practice of
regularly shifting the relative position of the two limbs of each circuit
as regards other wires in the same pole system</i>, as shown in <a href="#fig0965">fig. 965</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For short lines and pole systems with only a few wires it is not necessary
to transpose very frequently. On longer lines it has been found
amply sufficient to transpose once every quarter mile; that is to say to
change the relative position of the wires of the different circuits at posts
situated about that distance apart. This does not mean, however, that
each pair of wires is transposed so often, but that on ordinary sized
systems, the transposition of some one circuit is amply sufficient to secure
balanced relations and effectually counteract the effects of cross induction.
It is a matter which must be carefully calculated and planned in
each particular instance in order to secure the best advantages.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XL<br />

<small id="UNDERGROUND_WIRING">UNDERGROUND WIRING</small></h2>


<p>In large cities, the best method of running wires for all varieties
of electrical power transmission is to place them underground.
Many city authorities have made this method of wiring compulsory
by law, because of the difficulty in approaching a burning
building, the danger from crossed and falling wires, and the
disfigurement of the streets where there is a network of overhead
wires.</p>

<p>The expense of installing an underground system is very great
in comparison with that of overhead construction, but the cost
of maintenance is much less and the liability of interruption of
service greatly reduced.</p>

<p><b>Underground Systems.</b>—An underground system of electrical
conductors is composed of three essential elements:</p>

<p>1. The conductor itself, which is almost invariably of copper;</p>

<p>2. The insulation, which is either in the form of a complete
covering of insulating material, or simply insulated supporting
points;</p>

<p>3. The tube or conduit, which constitutes the mechanical
protection against the effects of the severe shocks, weather
conditions, etc., to which the system is naturally exposed.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_826">826</span></p>

<p>The various underground systems may be divided into three
classes:</p>

<p>
1. Lead encased cables laid directly in the ground;<br />
2. Solid or built in systems;<br />
3. Drawing in systems.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said of the first mentioned construction?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Where cables are laid directly in the ground, the
metallic covering, consisting usually of a lead tube, which is
placed over the insulation is depended upon for mechanical
protection. Such cables are largely used for short private
lines and the first cost is less than that of the others, but in
case of repairs it has to be dug up.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the drawing in system.</b></p>

<p>Ans. In this construction the cables are drawn in after the
conduits are built. The conduit of the drawing in system may
consist of various forms of pipe or troughs of iron, earthenware,
concrete, wood or fibre, while those of the solid or built in systems
are composed of either iron tubes or concrete trenches.</p>

<p><b>Conduits.</b>—The principal qualifications of a good conduit are
freedom from disintegration by the action of fire, water, acids,
alkalies, or electrolysis; second, a smooth interior surface so as to
permit of the easy drawing in of the cables; and third, a design
which will permit of its economical installation in crowded streets.
There are numerous kinds of conduit of which may be mentioned:</p>

<p>
1.  Vitrified clay pipe conduits;<br />

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 975.—A few forms of vitrified clay pipe conduits; view showing single and multiplex
types. The dimensions of each duct are about 3&frac12; &times; 3&frac12;. The lengths vary from two to
three feet.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Vitrified Clay Pipe Conduit.</b>—Various forms of vitrified
clay conduit appear to possess the qualifications, desirable in
underground construction, to a higher degree than any other
type. They are made in both single and multiple duct, as shown
in <a href="#fig0975">fig. 975</a>, the single type being about 3&frac12; inches in diameter,
or 3&frac12; inches square, and 18 inches long. Multiple conduit is
made in two, three, four, six and more sections, ranging from
2 to 3 feet in length.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_828">828</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. For what conditions is the single conduit especially
adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is most suitable for use where the sub-surface conditions
are characterized by a great crowding of gas, water, and
other pipes, as the conduits can be divided into several layers
so as to cross over or under such pipes, and many other sub-surface
obstructions which are present in the streets of large
cities and towns.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the features of the multiple duct
conduit?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It can be laid somewhat cheaper than the single duct
type, especially in lines of about two to four ducts; it is, therefore,
most suitable for use in outlying communities where the
streets are comparatively free from many sub-surface obstructions.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How is the conduit laid?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In laying conduit, a trench is dug, usually sufficiently
wide to allow the placing of three inches of concrete on each
side of the ducts, and sufficiently deep to hold at least thirty
inches of concrete on top of the upper layer of concrete forming
the conduit, and to allow for three inches of concrete in the
bottom. The trench is graded from some point near the middle
of the block to the manhole at each intersection, or from one
manhole to the next manhole, at a gradient not less than 2
inches to 100 feet.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are single duct conduits laid?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The tiles of the several ducts are placed close together,
and the joints plastered and filled with cement mortar consisting
of one part of Portland cement to one part of sand. When the
conduit is being laid, a wooden mandrel about four or five feet
long, three inches in diameter, and carrying a leather or rubber
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_829">829</span>
washer from three to eight inches larger at one end is drawn
through each duct so as to draw out any particles of foreign
matter or cement which may have become lodged in the joints,
and also to insure good alignment of the tiles, as shown in
<a href="#fig0977">fig. 977</a>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Single duct conduits are usually laid by bricklayers. This fact
accounts for the somewhat greater cost of the single over the multiple
conduit which is usually laid by ordinary laborers. One good brick-layer
and helper, however, will lay from 200 to 300 feet of single duct
conduit per hour.</p>

<p>Practically the same standard of construction is maintained on all
conduit lines from two ducts up to twenty-five ducts, as many of the
smaller lines may extend for miles into the outlying districts, and contain
transmission lines of the maximum working voltage.</p></blockquote>

troughs either simple or with partitions, the latter type being shown in the figure.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Vitrified Clay or Earthenware Trough Conduit.</b>—It consists
of troughs either simple or with partitions as shown in <a href="#fig0976">fig.
976</a>. They are usually made in tiles 3 or 4 inches square for each
compartment, with wall about one inch thick. The length of
the tiles ranges from two to four feet. Each of the two foot
form duct troughs weighs about 85 pounds. When laid complete,
the top trough is covered with a sheet of mild steel, about
No. 22 gauge, made to fit over the sides so as to hold it in position,
and then covered over with concrete.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_830">830</span></p>

<p><b>Joints in Multiple-duct Vitrified Clay Conduit.</b>—In laying
multiple duct earthenware conduit, the ducts or sections are
centered by means of dowel pins inserted in the holes at each
joint, which is then wrapped with a six inch strip of asphalted
burlap, or damp cheese cloth, and coated with cement mortar
as shown in <a href="#fig0978">fig. 978</a>. Economy of space and labor constitutes
the principal advantages derived from the use of multiple duct
conduit.</p>

are placed close together as shown in the figure, and the joints plastered and filled with
cement mortar consisting of one part Portland cement and one part sand.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Concrete Duct Conduits.</b>—These are usually constructed
by placing collapsible mandrels of wood or metal in a trench
where the ducts are desired and then filling the trench with
concrete. After the concrete has solidified, the mandrels are
taken out in pieces, leaving continuous longitudinal holes which
serve as ducts. Some builders produce a similar result by
placing tubes of sheet iron or zinc in the concrete as it is being
filled into the trench. These tubes have just enough strength
to withstand the pressure to which they are subjected, and are,
therefore, very thin and liable to be quickly destroyed by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_831">831</span>
corrosion, but the ducts formed by them will always remain
unimpaired in the hardened mass of concrete.</p>

<p><b>Wooden Duct Conduits.</b>—In this type of conduit, the ducts
are formed of wooden pipe, troughing, or boxes, and constitute
the simplest and cheapest form of conduit. A pipe conduit
consists of pieces of wood about 4&frac12; inches square, and three
to six feet long, with a round hole about three inches in diameter
bored through them longitudinally. As shown by <a href="#fig0979">fig. 979</a>
a cylindrical projection is turned on one end of each section,
which, when the conduit is laid fits into a corresponding recess
in one end of the next section. The sections are usually laid in
tiers, those of one tier breaking joint with those of the tiers
above or below.</p>

by the dowel pins shown in the cut.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_832">832</span></p>

<p>The trough conduit consists of ducts about 3 inches square
made of horizontal boards and vertical partitions, usually of
yellow pine about one inch in thickness. This form of conduit
can be laid in convenient lengths of 10 or 12 feet, or it can be
built along continuously.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the objection to the use of wood for
conduits?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The decay of the wood tends to form acid which corrodes
the lead sheath of the cable.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. How can this be prevented?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The decay of the wood can be prevented to a certain
extent by the application of sterilizing processes, thereby preserving
it in fairly good condition for about ten to fifteen years.</p>

<p><b>Ques. For what service is wooden conduit best adapted?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For temporary installations which will be discontinued
before the wood decays.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_833">833</span></p>

<p><b>Wooden Built-in Conduits.</b>—Within recent years several
forms of wooden built-in conduit have been designed and successfully
used for permanent work. They possess several advantages
over any of the duct systems, the chief of which are
high insulating quality, the capability of using bare wire and
rods for underground conductors, and reduced cost. An approved
form of wooden built-in conduit is shown in <a href="#fig0980">fig. 980</a>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig</span>. 980.—Perspective view of wooden built-in conduit. It consists of an outer rectangular
casing of wood which is lined inside with impregnated felt.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are wooden built-in conduits installed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A wooden trough is laid in a trench about 18 inches
deep. Porcelain carriers as shown in figs. 981 and 982 are
placed in the trough at intervals of 4 to 5 feet, to act as bridgework
for supporting the conductors. This bridgework is placed
on and is surrounded by impregnated felt or similar material,
and the spaces between the carriers, after the conductors have
been placed in position on them, is filled with voltax, which
hardens rapidly and forms a solid insulating material throughout
the conduit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_834">834</span></p>

<p><b>Wrought Iron or Steel Pipe Conduits.</b>—These are formed
of pipes similar to gas or steam pipes, with screw or other connections.
They are laid either simply in the earth, or in hydraulic
cement, and are the strongest and one of the most satisfactory
forms of underground conduit. An appropriate standard of this
kind of work is shown in <a href="#fig0983">fig. 983</a>.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the ordinary method of construction?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A trench, the width of which will depend upon the
number of pipes to be laid, is first dug in the ground, and after
its bottom has been carefully leveled, is braced with side planking
and filled to the depth of two to four inches with a layer of
good concrete, consisting of two parts of Rosendale cement,
three parts of sand, and five parts of broken stone capable of
passing through a one and one-half inch mesh. This concrete
is well secured in place and forms the bed for the lowermost layer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_835">835</span>
or tier of pipes. Ordinary wrought iron pipe is employed, in
20 foot lengths about three to four inches in diameter, depending
upon the size and number of cables they are intended to carry.
After the last tier of pipes have been put in place, and a layer of
concrete from two to four inches placed over it, a layer of two
inch yellow pine planking is laid over the whole.</p>

</div>

<blockquote>

<p>The pipe connections consist of a taper screw thread coupling which
can be easily made up as the pipes are laid, and which forms a tight joint.</p>

<p>The pipes in each tier are usually laid from &frac12; to &frac34; of their diameter
apart, and when the first tier is in place, the spaces between and around
the pipes are filled in with concrete which is carried up over the pipes
to a depth of about one-half a diameter to form the bed for another tier
of pipes.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the principal object of the top covering
of planks.</b></p>

<p>Ans. To protect the conduit against the tools of workmen
making later excavations.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_836">836</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Practical experience shows that workmen will dig through concrete
without stopping to investigate as to the character of the obstruction,
but under similar circumstances, will invariably turn away from wood.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How are the pipes treated before being laid?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are dipped in tar to protect the outside surface
from rust.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the most satisfactory form of lined
iron pipe?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Pipe lined with cement. The internal surfaces of these
pipes are usually covered with a lining of pure Rosendale cement
about ⅝ inch thick and containing no sand. The internal surface
of the cement lining does not offer much friction to the
introduction or withdrawal of the conductors.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>These pipes are laid in cement or concrete in the same manner as
plain iron pipe, and are given a coating of tar on the outside to prevent
rusting.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Cast Iron Pipe and Trough Conduit.</b>—Cast iron pipe for
underground conduits is similar to ordinary wrought iron pipe,
except that it is thicker. The additional thickness is necessary
to make the strength equal to that of wrought iron; it is therefore
heavier to handle and more expensive.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a cast iron trough conduit.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It consists of shallow troughs of cast iron in six foot
lengths, laid directly in the earth so as to form a system of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_837">837</span>
continuous troughing in which the conductors are placed and
then covered over by cast iron covers which are bolted to the
trough.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What advantages does this form of conduit possess
over the duct type?</b></p>

<p>Ans. First, the cables can be laid directly in place, thus
eliminating any chance of injury during the process of drawing
in, and second, the cables are easily accessible at any point by
simply removing one or two of the sectional cast iron covers,
thus permitting of their being readily inspected and repaired.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 984.—Fibre conduit. It consists of pipes made of wood pulp, having about the same
thickness as cast iron pipe. Slip joint conduit for electrical subways is three inches inside
diameter. The socket joints keep the lengths centered and make it easier to lay than a
mere butt joint. It is laid in cement like iron pipe.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Branch connections can be made with greater facility than in the case
of any duct system, so that it is especially suitable for distribution
systems were it not for the fact that it is so expensive as to be practically
prohibitive.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Fibre Conduits.</b>—This form of conduit consists of pipes
made of wood pulp impregnated with a bituminous preservative
and insulating compound. These pipes are laid in concrete in
a manner similar to iron pipe. Fibre conduits are made in sizes
ranging from 1 inch to 4 inches in diameter and from 2&frac12; to 5
feet in length, with walls ranging from &frac14; to &frac12; inch in thickness.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_838">838</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Name the three types of fibre conduit.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The socket joint type, as shown in <a href="#fig0984">fig. 984</a>, the sleeve
type, <a href="#fig0985">fig. 985</a>, and the screw joint type, <a href="#fig0986">fig. 986</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the usual method of laying the socket
joint type of fibre conduit?</b></p>

<p>Ans. After the trench has been dug to the required width
and depth, depending upon the number or pipes to be placed in
a tier and the number of tiers, a bed of concrete about 3 inches
deep is placed on the bottom and a line drawn on one side for
the alignment of the first line of pipes. The other lines of pipe
or ducts are laid parallel to the first line, and are separated from
it and from each other by means of &frac14; inch or &frac12; inch wooden
or iron pegs. The pipes are well grouted and covered with a
layer of concrete to the depth of &frac14; or &frac12; inch, and the next
tier laid in place in the same manner. When the final tier of
pipes has been installed, it is covered with a layer of concrete
about 2 to 3 inches deep.</p>

here shown are easily aligned without the use of a mandrel.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is done when it is necessary to cut a length
of pipe to break joints, or to enter a manhole?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The remaining part of the length may be utilized by
using a fibre conduit sleeve having an inside diameter &frac12;
inch greater than the pipe being used on the system.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_839">839</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>These sleeves are furnished by the manufacturers at a nominal charge
per foot. They are about four inches in length and fit over the ends of
the abutting pipes, so that they make tight joints and give perfect
alignment.</p>

<p>Although its employment is not permitted where fireproof regulations
are in force, fibre conduit is now being extensively used in other places,
and is giving satisfactory service. It is not affected by moist earth and
is impervious to the action of acids, alkalies, and gases. As it is not
subject to expansion and contraction, leakage is practically eliminated,
and since it is a very good insulator, troubles due to stray currents are
reduced to a minimum. It is extremely light, comparatively non-breakable,
and can be accurately laid at the rate of 12,000 duct feet per
day by a gang of common laborers, consisting of two layers and three
helpers.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Edison Tube System.</b>—Of the various built in or solid
underground conduit systems other than those already described
under wooden conduit systems, the most satisfactory are the
Edison tube system, the Crompton naked conductor system,
the Kennedy system, which is a modification of the Crompton
and the Callender systems.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the Edison tube system.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It consists of a series of iron tubes or pipes containing
one or more copper conductors which are placed therein before
each complete section or pipe leaves the factory, so that they
only need to be joined together to form a continuous line of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_840">840</span>
underground conduit with conductors in place. The arrangement
of wires and the details of the Edison tube system are
shown in figs. 987 to 989.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 987.</span>—Cross section of Edison "feeder" tube. This runs from the power station to the
centers of distribution, and contains two principal conductors and a smaller conductor to

wire each. These cables form independent circuits and enable the voltages at the distant
end of the feeder to be read at the central station. For this reason they are commonly
called pressure wires.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Underground Cables.</b>—Electric light and power cables for
use in conduit may be divided into two classes: <i>moisture proof</i>,
and <i>non-moisture proof</i>, according to the character of the
insulator. In the moisture proof cables, the insulation consists
of some form of rubber, or of bitumen, and a metal sheath or
covering, usually of lead, is provided to protect the cable from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_841">841</span>
mechanical or chemical injuries. The non-moisture proof cables
are insulated with paper impregnated with oil, wax, or resinous
compounds.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 988.</span>—Cross section of Edison "main" tube. A number of these tubes, which radiate
from the center of distribution and loop the ends of the feeders together, have three conductors
of the same size. These tubes are placed in the ground so as to bring the positive
and negative conductors on one side of the center of the tube, and the neutral conductor
on the other side. The mains are always laid with the neutral conductor adjacent to the
curb line, and for convenience this side of the tube is commonly called the <i>inside</i>. The
feeders are always laid with the positive conductor on the right hand side, as shown in
<a href="#fig0989">fig. 989</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Metal Sheaths on Underground Cables.</b>—Metal sheaths
are used on rubber covered cables to protect the insulating
compounds from the deteriorating effects of electrolysis and
various kinds of acids and gases which, under present methods
of construction, are ever present in the underground conduits.
It is a fact, however, that the lead sheath on a low tension cable,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_842">842</span>
which is used as one side of a grounded circuit, has been, in some
cases the cause of, instead of, cure for electrolysis. The proper
cure lies in the omission of the sheath altogether, but as this is
not practical except in the case of very large conductors, the
best thing that can be done is to interrupt the continuity of the
sheath by some form of insulating joint.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig0989" src="images/fig0989.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 989.</span>—Method of laying Edison underground tube system. The tubes are laid in trenches
about 30 inches deep and 20 inches wide at the bottom, each trench usually containing
two lines of pipes—a <i>main</i> adjacent to the curb and a <i>feeder</i> on the outside. The copper
rods forming the conductors are uniformly 20 feet, 4 inches in length and project from 2
to 3&frac12; inches from each end of the pipes, which are connected together by means of coupling
boxes. The coupling box usually employed consists of a two part egg shaped casting
into which the ends of the pipes enter through water tight sleeves at the opposite ends of
the oval. The projecting ends of the copper conductors are joined by short pieces of
flexible cable with sockets on each end, which are drilled to fit easily over the conductor
rods to which they are thoroughly soldered in order to make a perfect electrical joint.
After the conductors have been thus properly connected the cover is bolted down on the
lower half, and the whole of the interior of the box is filled with insulating compound
through the small hole at the top of the cover, thereby completely insulating the copper
conductors, the cable connectors, and the ends of the tubes. Finally, the hole in the cover
is closed with a cast iron cap. These coupling boxes are also made in the form of tees for
making branch connections, and in the form of elbows for turning corners, the ball ends
attached to the tubes and the sockets into which they fit being designed to permit of variation
in direction through an arc of 18 degrees on either side of the central position. <i>Services</i>
or branches to the consumers' premises consist of short lengths of tube which tap the
mains by means of three way or four way service boxes, the latter readily permitting the
taking of two services from one joint. Services are never taken from the feeders, but the
latter are brought to distributing boxes containing three copper rings to which the conductors
are connected and branched out to one or more mains which are led out through
fuses to supply the districts.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_843">843</span></p>

<p><b>Pot Heads.</b>—The upper end of a lateral cable is equipped
with a discharge bell, which is commonly called a pot head.
The purpose of a pot head is to hermetically seal the end of
the cable and bring the conductors out in such a manner as to
permit of their being conveniently connected to the primary
service boxes.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 990.</span>—Bottom of General Electric manhole junction box; view from manhole interior.
The cables enter the bottom of the box as shown through composition nozzles to which
the lead sheathes are united by a wiped solder connection, forming a permanent water and
gas tight joint. Stuffing boxes are sometimes substituted, doing away with the wiped
joint, rendering the boxes suitable for use with unleaded or braided cables. The normal
position of the distributing cables is in the upper ducts so that they may be brought to
the junction box without crossing other lines. The entrance nozzles and seats are so
arranged that all terminals are soldered to cables outside of box and any cable may be
removed without disturbing any soldered joint. The wiped joints unite electrically the
lead sheathes of all cables entering the box and by connecting a single earth bond to the
shell of the box all cable sheathes are solidly grounded. Incombustible shields prevent
the arc from a blown fuse making a ground connection to the shell or inner cover.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How are pot heads made?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are usually made in three parts, the base being
of cast brass, having a diameter depending upon the size of the
conductors, with a hole in the lower end threaded within in such
a manner as to make a tight fit on the cable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_844">844</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How is a pot head connected to a cable?</b></p>

<p>Ans. After the cable has been bent in to the proper position,
the brass base is slipped down over it with the larger end up,
and then screwed down on the lead sheath. The threads cut
down into the lead sheath to a distance of about &frac12; inch along
the sheath, thus making an air tight connection without necessitating
the making of a wiped joint.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The separate conductors are now bared of their insulation for a distance
of about two inches, and then spliced to heavy rubber covered braided
wire of sufficient length to reach the primary service boxes. The joints
connecting these rubber covered wires and the cable conductors are
spliced in the same manner as straight splices, the paper sleeves used
being of sufficient diameter to be backed out of the way over the rubber
insulation. When the splice is completed a brass shell threaded at one
end to fit a female thread in the upper end of the brass base, is
slipped over the end of the rubber covered wire and screwed into the
base. A hood of sheet copper having the form of a quarter section of a
ball is slipped over the top of the frame and its lower edge tracked in
position below the horizontal shelf. This hood makes the pot head
water, snow, and insect proof.</p></blockquote>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI<br />

<small id="WIRING_OF_BUILDINGS">WIRING OF BUILDINGS</small></h2>


<p>In laying out the circuits for a dwelling house, the cut out
cabinets should be located first. In many houses only one cut out
cabinet is necessary, but in large houses it is convenient to have
one on each floor, with vertical mains running through them
from the top to the bottom of the house.</p>

<p>If only one distributing point be used, it should be either in
the cellar or attic and risers run to the different floors.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should the distributing centers or cut out
cabinets be located?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be installed near a partition that is so
located as to make the running of risers easy, and should be on
an inside wall to guard against dampness.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What instructions are usually given the electrician

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_850">850</span>
with the neutral wire so as to make the capacity of the neutral
equal to the sum of the other two. If a three wire two wire
system had been originally installed, no change in the wiring
system would be necessary. The only change would be at
the service end of the switchboard, and the doubling of the

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 997.</span>—Three wire convertible, or three wire two wire system; used to advantage where
power is supplied from an outside source and brought in through the three wire system.
The only difference between the three wire convertible, and the straight three wire system
is that the center, or neutral, wire of the mains and feeders should have a current capacity
equal to the other two. The reason for this is that it allows the system to be readily
changed over to a two wire system for use in connection with a private plant. It sometimes
happens that after using power from the local electric illuminating company for some
time, conditions arise which make it expedient for the owners to install a private electric
plant. If a straight three wire system had been originally installed, the mains and the
feeders when used on a two wire system would not be heavy enough by 25 per cent., as the
neutral wire of a straight three wire system is the same in size as one of the two outer wires,
and theoretically carries one-half the current or less.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_851">851</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Is a three wire system desirable with an isolated
plant?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is more expensive to install than one for a two wire
system, as it is necessary to add a balancer in connection with a
240 volt dynamo. This balancer set should have one-tenth the
capacity of the plant. Such an equipment has its advantages
when 240 volt motors and 120 volt lamps are connected to the
system. With this plant no changes in the motors are necessary,
whereas in a straight 120 volt system, the motors would have to
be changed from 240 to 120 volt machines.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. After deciding on the system of wiring to be
used, how should the electrician proceed with the work?</b></p>

<p>Ans. He should lay out the mains, feeders and branches of
the wiring system. The outlets are first located and then the
distributing centers. There is no fixed rule or plan by which to
go, but the current density and source of supply are the main
points to be considered in locating these centers. He must also
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_852">852</span>
consider the construction of the building and select runways
and shafts which provide easy runs for feeders.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should panel boards be placed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Panel boards in loft buildings or in any building requiring
8 to 10 circuits to a floor should be distributed one to a
floor. In private houses it is sometimes advisable to install only
one panel for the entire house. This is good practice for a
three-story house not requiring over twelve circuits.</p>

is useful in laying out the feeder system. In the building here shown it will be seen that
the basement and first floor require the most power. In such a case a feeder is run for
these floors, and a sub-feeder from the basement to the first floor. It is not worth while
to reduce the size of the sub-feeder unless the amount of current used on the sub-feeder be a
small percentage of that used in the feeder. Another reason is that in changing the size of
a wire, the underwriters require a fuse to be inserted. This makes it necessary to install a
larger panel with larger trim, etc., and the consequent expense easily offsets any gain made
by installing a smaller wire.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>In a building covering a large area it is often advisable to install two
panels or centers to a floor, with two sets of feeders. It is advisable to
keep circuit lengths down to 100 feet or less, and the judicious laying
out of circuit centers will save many feet of wiring.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_853">853</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How should the arrangement of feeders for a
large building be determined?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A good method is to draw an elevation of the building
as in <a href="#fig0999">fig. 999</a>, and note on each floor the current requirements.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The best plan is to furnish a feeder for every floor, especially in large

local lighting company, it is a good plan to have each circuit controlled

conduit; if the circuit work were installed at the time the building is erected, it would
cost but little more than moulding, and would be much more substantial. In some cases,
however, wooden moulding might be provided in a new building on the ceiling as a means

<h2>CHAPTER XLII<br />

<small id="SIGN_FLASHERS">SIGN FLASHERS</small></h2>


<p>The devices used for giving the flashing and changeable
effects to electric lights in any form are called "flashers." The
mechanism may be constructed to flash a sign by spelling the
words out, one letter at a time, flashing border lights around a
window, changing colors in glass signs, or in fact in any way to
attract the eye.</p>

<p>There are two advantages in favor of using a flasher: 1, it
causes the passerby to look at the sign, and 2, reduces the cost
of electricity, because the lamps are switched off periodically.</p>

<p>There are numerous kinds of flasher, and they may be classified,
according to construction of the switch contacts, as:</p>

<p>
1.  Carbon type;<br />
2.  Brush type;<br />
3.  Knife type.<br />
</p>

<p>Again, with respect to operation or the electrical effects, they
may be classified as</p>

<p>
1.  Simple on and off flashers;<br />
2.  High speed flashers;<br />
3.  Lightning flashers;<br />

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,011</span>—Dull's carbon type flasher. This is a main line flasher; that is, it is set into the
main wires instead of carrying down each circuit. The circuits are opened and closed on
carbon contacts, reinforced with standard knife switches. The blades are opened and the
current broken by gravity alone. Each switch can be made to hold the lights for any
period from 18% to 81% of a revolution of the shaft. They can throw on the circuits
progressively or all on and all off together. Again, the circuits may be closed progressively,
remain on a few seconds, and then be opened progressively. No circuit or circuits can be
closed more than once per revolution.</p>

<p><b>Carbon Flashers.</b>—In this type of flasher, carbon breaks
are provided, that is, the arc which is formed when the circuit is
broken, falls on carbon, while metal switches are provided to
carry the load. Thus the carbon gets the arc which prevents the
switches burning, while the switches carry the load to prevent the
carbons becoming heated and disintegrated. The carbons must
be adjusted occasionally according to the load they are carrying.
Carbon machines are made either double, triple, or series break.

load is balanced by running the neutral wire around
the machine, to the cut outs, breaking the outside
"legs" only of a 220-110 volt system. While this
method of wiring is entirely feasible, it is no harder
on the contacts, and permits the use of a cheaper
machine, but it is technically a violation of the
underwriters' rules, which say that all circuits of
more than 660 watts must be broken double pole. If
the load be balanced there would be double pole
break at 220 volts, and the lamps would be in series,
but if the load be not exactly balanced, there would
be single breaking to the extent of the amperes over
the average balance. In other words, it is a double
break and it is not according to circumstances, and
the use of this machine wired as above is a matter
that should be taken up with the local inspector

and the secondary of an induction coil are connected in series. When the circuit through the
primary of the induction coil is closed, sufficient pressure is induced in the secondary to cause
sparks to jump across every jet in the series. Since the voltage is high, the wires must be
installed with great precaution. The wire should be enclosed in glass tubing wherever it comes

<p>In operation, the lamps are turned on and off so rapidly that
it produces the effect of snakes.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>It is not advisable to build these signs small nor cheaply, as in order
to produce the desired effect, the curved path taken by the snake should
cover at least 10 inches width, which would mean a total of 20 inches
lateral space for the snake in addition to the electric letters in the center.

<p><b>Ques. Why are chaser signs expensive?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is on account of the care required in their construction,
large amount of wiring necessary and large flasher required.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A sign four by ten feet outside dimensions, would require in the neighborhood
of 150 lamps in the border alone on each side. This would
require a flasher with 75 switches and about 82 wires to run between
the sign and flasher.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How are chaser signs worked?</b></p>

<p>Ans. There are several ways of operating these signs. The
border is generally working continuously, while the center can
be flashed or not, as may be desired. Flashing the wording
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_878">878</span>
reduces the current expense, which offsets in a measure the extra

<blockquote>

<p>The  border, although working continuously consumes very little
current.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the relative cost of a one snake sign as
compared with a two snake sign?</b></p>

<p>Ans. One snake running around the border would cost twice
as much for flasher and wiring as a two snake flasher.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Three snakes would cost about 25 per cent. less for flasher and wiring
than for two snakes. The smaller the number of snakes travelling

expand more, thus forcing the point of the screw N down upon the brass plate, which will
result in the winding about the brass strip being shorted and the full voltage will be

shorted there will of course be no current in its winding and the brass strip will cool down,
the screw N will finally be drawn away from contact with the brass plate, and the winding
again connected in series with the lamp. The lamp will apparently go out when the

when the circuit is closed at the time <i>P</i> is down, lamp group No. 1 will light up, the current
passing through <i>H</i> on its way. The air in <i>B</i> consequently expands, and gradually
forces the mercury down in <i>B</i>, along <i>T</i>, and up in <i>B'</i>. The arm <i>A</i> will gradually become
horizontal, and will then overbalance, <i>P</i> being withdrawn from <i>MC</i>, and <i>P'</i> dipped into

<i>H</i> will cool down, and <i>H'</i> will warm up. Thus, in due course, <i>A</i> will be tilted the other
way again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII<br />

<small id="LIGHTNING_PROTECTION">LIGHTNING PROTECTION</small></h2>


<p>A lightning arrester is an apparatus designed to provide a
path by which lightning disturbances or other static discharges
may pass to earth. Lightning arresters may be divided into three
classes, according as their action depends upon the effects of:</p>

<p>
1.  Sharp points;<br />
2.  Air gaps;<br />
3.  Sharp turns.<br />
</p>

<p><b>Lightning Rods.</b>—This form of arrester consists of a conducting
rod or cable erected on the outside of a building and
connected to earth, in order to afford protection from lightning
by carrying the lightning discharge into the ground; or to prevent
lightning by leading the electricity from the earth to the
cloud without disturbance.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Why do lightning rods terminate in sharp
points?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The action of the rod depends on the discharging effect
of a sharp point as follows: When an electrically charged cloud
approaches a building provided with a lightning rod, it induces
an opposite charge in the earth and in the rod which is connected
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_886">886</span>
to the earth. As soon as the charge on the point becomes strong
enough to break apart the molecules of the air in front of it, a
stream of electrified particles, opposite in sign to that of the
charge on the cloud, passes from the neighborhood of the rod
to the cloud and thus neutralizes the charge of the cloud.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should a lightning rod be erected?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The conductor should be carried to all high points
of the building it is to protect and should be well insulated from
the latter and grounded in deep wet earth, independent of gas
or water pipes. Sharp bends and corners should be avoided.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,039.—Diagram showing principle of air gap arrester: lightning discharges more readily at
sharp points than along flat surfaces.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Why have lightning rods fallen into disfavor?</b></p>

<p>Ans. On account of numerous failures due to faulty installations,
and non-maintenance of the rod in good condition, also
because of the excessive prices charged by unscrupulous dealers
for rods and their erection.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>A lightning rod with defective insulation or broken ground connection
is a danger rather than a protection.</p></blockquote>
<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_887">887</span></p>

<p><b>Air Gap Arresters.</b>—Many of the lightning arresters used
for the protection of electrical apparatus depend upon the fact
that lightning discharges will jump across air spaces that are
good insulators for the regular working current, while they find
difficulty in passing through circuits containing electromagnets.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

are attached to the two plates provided with points. The ground wire being connected

is a good form for short lines.</p>
</div>

<p>The principle of air gap arresters is illustrated in <a href="#fig1039">fig. 1,039</a>.
There are two brass plates slightly separated; one is connected
to the line and the other is grounded. The air gap between
the plates is very small and the resistance thus interposed,
while sufficient to prevent the regular working current jumping
across, is not great enough to interfere with a lightning discharge
which readily jumps the gap and passes off to earth.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_888">888</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Why are teeth provided on the plates?</b></p>

<p>Ans. For the same reason that points are used on lightning
rods. That is, when electricity at high pressure accumulates at
such points the surrounding air is electrified and the charge
escapes by means of the charged air particles.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,041.—Mason multi-discharge lightning arrester. The construction of this arrester is
based on the well known principle that lightning discharges more readily at points or angles
than elsewhere. The wire is wound around square carbon rods, which are connected to
the ground, the line being insulated from the rods by sheets of mica. The wire itself being
square, instead of round, adds to the efficiency of the arrester, by increasing the number of
points or angles.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. For what kind of service is the form of arrester
just described used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is suitable for telegraph and telephone lines where
currents of very low voltage are employed.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Why is it not used on lines employing higher
voltage, such as in electric light and power stations?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Current at high pressure would follow the lightning
across the gap and establish an arc or continuous flame from
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_889">889</span>
one plate to the other thus quickly destroying the plates and
causing other more serious damage.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What provision is made to prevent the destruction
of arresters by the line current?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Lightning arresters used on heavy duty circuits are
designed to rupture the arc as soon as formed.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,042.—Diagram showing operation of variable gap arc breaker used on heavy duty lightning
arresters. When a lightning discharge passes across the gap to earth, the dynamo
current follows it and energizes the magnet M, which attracts the short arm of the double
lever, thus quickly jerking the terminal B away from C. The wider air gap thus interposed
between B and C greatly increases the resistance which breaks the arc.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How is this done?</b></p>

<p>Ans. There are several methods, of which may be mentioned
the variable gap method described in <a href="#fig1042">fig. 1,042</a>, and the magnetic
blow out method shown in <a href="#fig1043">fig. 1,043</a>.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Where should lightning arresters be placed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be placed as near as possible to the point
where wires enter a building, and in an easily accessible place
away from combustible material.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_890">890</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What should be avoided in installing lightning
arresters?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Kinks and sharp bends in the wire running from the
outdoor lines to the arresters and from arresters to ground should
be avoided as far as possible.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Why should kinks and sharp bends be avoided?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Because they offer resistance to the lightning discharge.</p>

within a short distance of one another, are bent divergently. These wires are supported on

The normal line pressure is insufficient to bridge the gap, even at its narrowest portion, but
an extra high pressure whether due to lightning or to other disturbing phenomena, will bridge
the gap at its narrowest point and establish a path to earth. When, however, the main current
attempts to flow across, phenomena of electromagnetic repulsion force the arc upward
along the horns, lengthening and attenuating it, until it finally becomes extinguished.</p>

securely soldered to a brass plug firmly screwed into the pipe, and both
strongly stapled to the pole so there will be little danger of the connection
being broken.</p>

<p>A good ground is important, as the efficiency of the protection would
be impaired if the ground connection were poor. Wherever the earth is
dry and a good ground cannot surely be obtained, an excavation 4 or 5
feet deep should be made, and after placing the copper ground plate or
iron pipe in the hole, it should be filled with crushed coke or charcoal
about pea size. This improves the electrical connection between pipe
or plate and earth.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. Does lightning often strike telephone or electric
light lines?</b></p>

<p>Ans. No, the lines become charged to a high pressure by
induction from lightning flashes or from the passing of clouds
that are highly charged.

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV<br />

<small id="STORAGE_BATTERIES">STORAGE BATTERIES</small></h2>


<p><b>Introduction.</b>—The practical development of the storage
battery is comparatively recent, although a knowledge of the
phenomena upon which its actions are based, dates back to 1801.
In 1800, the year made memorable by Volta's discovery of the
galvanic battery, Nicholson and Carlisle found that a current
from Volta's cell could decompose water.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In 1801, Gautherot discovered that if two plates of platinum or silver,
immersed in a suitable electrolyte, be connected to the terminals of
an active primary cell and current be allowed to flow, a small current
could be obtained on an outside circuit connecting these two electrodes
as soon as the primary battery had been disconnected.</p>

<p>Erman found that the positive pole of such a cell, was the pole which
had been connected to the positive pole of the battery.</p>

<p>In 1803, Ritter observed, with gold wire, the same phenomenon as
Gautherot, and constructed the first secondary battery, by superposing
plates of gold, separated by cloth discs, moistened with ammonia.</p>

<p>Volta, Davy, Marianini, and others added somewhat to the knowledge
on the subject, and in 1837, Schoenbein found that peroxide of lead
could be used in secondary batteries.</p>

<p>Sir William Grove next came forward with the discovery that metal
plates, with a layer of oxide on them, acted better than the plain metallic
plates, and Wheatstone and Siemens found still later that peroxide of
lead was the best for such purposes.</p>

<p>In 1842, Grove constructed a gas battery, in which the electromotive
force came from the oxygen and hydrogen evolved in the electrolysis of
water acidulated with sulphuric acid. By means of fifty such cells, he
obtained an arc light.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_894">894</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Michael Faraday, when electrolyzing a solution of lead acetate, found
that peroxide was produced at the positive, and metallic lead at the
negative pole, and in his "Experimental Researches," he comments on
the high conductivity of lead peroxide, and its power of readily giving
up its oxygen. Although he made no apparent use of this discovery,
it may be considered as the next important step in the development of
the storage battery.</p>

<p>According to Niblett, Wheatstone, de la Rue, and Niaudet were well
aware that peroxide of lead was a powerful depolarizer, but nobody
appears to have made use of this fact until 1860, when M. Gaston Plante
constructed his well known cell with coiled plates. Plante's researches
extended up to 1879, and practically determined the state of the art.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,046.—One plate or "grid" of a type of storage cell constructed by inserting buttons or
ribbons of the proper chemical substances in perforations. Some such cells use crimped
ribbons of metallic lead for inserting in the perforations, others pure red lead or other
suitable material.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>As to the theory at this time, it may be stated that Clerk Maxwell,
although the leading electrician of his time, speaks of the storage battery
as storing up a quantity of energy in a manner somewhat analogous
to the ordinary condenser; hence the use of the word "accumulator"
for storage battery.</p>

<p>In 1879, R. L. Metzer did away with the tedious forming process, by
mechanically applying the active material. This important discovery
was not, however, generally known, until 1881, when Camille Faure
obtained important patents concerning the method of shortening the
time of formation.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_895">895</span></p>
<blockquote>

<p>Charles F. Brush, working independently of either Faure or Metzer,
arrived at the same result, and the United States courts have decided,
after long litigation, that to him belongs the priority of invention in
this country.</p></blockquote>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_896">896</span>
has to be carried only for two or three hours a day. To carry
the entire load at minimum hours. To act as equalizer or reservoir.

<p><b>Theory of the Storage Battery.</b>—The action of the storage
battery is practically the same as that of the primary battery
and it is subject to the same general laws. The cells of a storage
battery are connected in the same way as primary cells, and when
charged is capable of generating a current of electricity in a
manner similar to that of a primary battery. It differs, however,
from the primary battery in that it is capable of being recharged
after exhaustion by passing an electric current through it in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_897">897</span>
direction opposite to that of the current on discharge. This
difference constitutes the principal advantage of the storage
battery over the primary battery.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. Describe a storage cell.</b></p>

<p>Ans. A storage cell consists of plates or of grids in an electrolyte,
of such a character that the electrical energy supplied to
it is converted into chemical energy (a process called charging).
The chemical energy can be reconverted into electrical energy
(a process called discharging).
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_898">898</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the electrolyte generally used.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It consists of a weak solution of sulphuric acid which
permits ready conduction of the current from the primary battery,
the greater the proportion of acid within certain limits,
the smaller the resistance offered.</p>

grids are made from an alloy of lead and antimony; hard lead straps which are burned
together, are used for joining the plates. Specially treated separators are used.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of the current passing through
the electrolyte?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It decomposes the water into oxygen and hydrogen;
this is indicated by the formation of bubbles upon the exposed
surfaces of both plates, these bubbles being formed by oxygen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_899">899</span>
gas on the plate connected to the positive pole of the primary
battery, and hydrogen on the plate connected to the negative
pole.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Because, however, the oxygen is unable to attack either platinum or
silver under such conditions, the capacity of such a device to act as an
electrical accumulator is practically limited to the point at which both
plates are covered with bubbles. After this point the gases will begin
to escape into the atmosphere.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the prime condition for operation of a
storage battery?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The resistance of the electrolyte should be as low as
possible in order that the current may pass freely and with full
effect between the electrodes. If the resistance of the electrolyte
be too small, the intensity of the current will cause the water to
boil rather than to occasion the electrolytic effects noted above.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What happens when the charging current is discontinued,
and the two electrodes joined by an outside
wire?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A small current will flow through the outside circuit,
being due to the recomposition of the acid and water solution.
The process is in a very definite sense a reversal of that by
which the current is generated in a primary cell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Hydrogen collected upon the negative plate, which was the cathode, so
long as the primary battery was in circuit, is given off to the liquid
immediately surrounding it, uniting with its particles of oxygen and
causing the hydrogen, in combination with them, to unite with the
particles of oxygen next adjacent. The process is continued until the
opposite positive plate is reached, when the oxygen collected there is
finally combined with the surplus hydrogen, going to it from the surrounding
solution.</p>

<p>This chemical process causes the current to emerge from the positive
plate, which was the anode, so long as the primary battery was in
circuit. The current thus produced will continue until the recomposition
of the gases is complete; then ceasing because these gases, as before
stated, do not combine with the metal of the electrodes.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_900">900</span></p>

<p><b>Types of Storage Battery.</b>—There are three classes of storage
cell which are commercially important:</p>

<p>
1.  Plante cells;<br />
2.  Faure cells;<br />
3.  Alkaline cells.<br />
</p>

<p>According to construction secondary cells may be classified
as follows:</p>

<p>
1.  Lead sulphuric acid cells;<br />
2.  Lead copper cells;<br />
3.  Lead zinc cells;<br />
4.  Alkaline zincate cells.<br />
</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The lead sulphuric acid type includes all those cells belonging to the
Plante and Faure groups.</p>

<p>Lead copper cells consist of sheets of metal coated with lead oxide,
serving as the positive electrode, and copper plates for the negative
electrodes. These plates are immersed in a solution of copper sulphate.
Cells belonging to this class are not employed in commercial practice,
being useful only for laboratory experiments.</p>

<p>Lead zinc cells are similar to the preceding type, but differ by having
zinc for the negative electrode, and zinc sulphate for the electrolyte.
The voltage of these cells is slightly higher than that of the ordinary cell,
and their capacity per unit of total weight is high, but they are apt to
lose their charge on open circuit, besides they possess most of the disadvantages
of the Plante cells.</p>

<p>Alkaline zincate cells have copper for the positive, and iron for the
negative electrode. The electrolyte is composed of sodium, or potassium,
zincate. Cells of this type are used to some extent for traction
purposes.</p>

<p>In addition to the above there are some special forms of cell which
do not belong to the four preceding types.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the Plante type.</b></p>

<p>Ans. In the Plante type the lead is chemically attacked and
finally converted into lead peroxide, probably after it has gone
through several intermediate changes. The plates are all formed
as positive plates first and then all that are intended for negative
plates are reversed, the peroxide being changed into sponge lead.

<p><b>Ques. What is done to make the Plante plate more
efficient?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The surfaces are finely subdivided, the following methods
being those common: scoring, grooving, casting, laminating,
pressing, and by the use of lead wool.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the Faure or pasted type.</b></p>

<p>Ans. This form of plate is constructed by attaching the
active material by some mechanical means to a grid proper.
The active material first used for this purpose was red lead,
which was reduced in a short time to lead peroxide when connected
as the positive or anode, or to spongy metallic lead when
connected as the cathode or negative, thus forming plates of the
same chemical compound as in the Plante type.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The materials used at the present time by the manufacturers for
making this paste are largely a secret with them, but in general they
consist of pulverized lead or lead oxide mixed with some liquid to make
a paste.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How do Faure plates compare with those of the
Plante type?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They are usually lighter and have a higher capacity,
but have a tendency to shed the material from the grid, thus
making the battery useless.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Many ways have been tried for mechanically holding the active material
on the grid, the general method involving a special design in the
shape of the grid. Some of these designs are: 1, solid perforated sheets
of lattice work; 2, corrugated and solid recess plates not perforated;
3, ribbed plates with projecting portions; 4, grid cast around active
material; 5, lead envelopes, and 6, triangular troughs as horizontal ribs.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>The Electrolyte.</b>—Sulphuric acid is generally used as electrolyte;
the acid should be made from sulphur and not from pyrites,
as the latter is liable to contain injurious substances.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_904">904</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How is the electrolyte prepared?</b></p>

<p>Ans. One part of chemically pure concentrated sulphuric acid
is mixed with several parts of water. The proportion of water
differs with several types of cell from three to eight parts, as
specified in the directions accompanying the cells.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What test is necessary in preparing the
electrolyte?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In mixing the water and acid, the hydrometer should
be used to test the specific gravity<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> of both the acid and the
solution. The most suitable acid should show a specific gravity
of about 1.760 or 66&deg; Baum&eacute;.</p>

<p><b>Ques. In preparing the electrolyte, how should the
water and acid be mixed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The mixture should be made by pouring the acid slowly
into the water, <i>never the reverse</i>. As cannot be too strongly
stated, in mixing, the liquid should be stirred with a clean
wooden stick, the acid being added to the water slowly; the
latter is corrosive and will painfully burn the flesh.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Distilled or rain water should be used in preparing the electrolyte.
When made, the solution should be allowed to cool for several hours
or until its temperature is approximately that of the atmosphere (60
being the average). At this point it should have a specific gravity of
about 1.200 or 25&deg; Baum&eacute;. If the hydrometer show a higher reading,
water may be added until the correct reading is obtained; if a lower
reading, dilute acid may be added with similar intent.</p>

<p>The electrolyte should never be mixed in jars containing the battery
plates, but preferably in stone vessels, specially prepared for the purpose.
Furthermore, it should never be placed in the cell until perfectly cool.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of mixing the acid and the
water?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The mixture becomes hot.</p>

<p class="center">Before using, the mixture should be allowed to cool.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_906">906</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What kind of a vessel should be used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The vessel should be of glass, glazed earthenware, or
lead.</p>

<p><b>Ques. At what density is the resistance of dilute sulfuric
acid at a minimum?</b></p>

<p>Ans. At 1.260.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of a deep containing vessel?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Parts of the plate surface may do more than their share
of the work due to the difference in the density of the electrolyte
at the top and bottom. The containing vessel should, therefore,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_907">907</span>
never be deeper than about 20 inches unless some artificial
means of acid circulation be used.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of changes in temperature on

<p>Ans. The resistance of the electrolyte is changed, being less
for increase of temperature.</p>

<p><b>Charging.</b>—Before beginning to charge a storage battery, it
should be gone over carefully, and any cell that is not up to the
standard should be disconnected and put in working order
before being replaced. In general, if the current used in charging
be too large, it will waste energy by evolving an excess of heat
and gas; if too small, an insulating deposit of white lead sulphate
will be formed on the positive plate, thereby preventing
the formation of the proper amount of lead peroxide.</p>

has four mountings, two being pockets to contain stuffing boxes about the terminal posts.
One of the other two is a separator which separates spray from the escaping gas while the

consists of a 21% solution of potash in distilled water with a small per cent. of lithia.
The density of the electrolyte does not change on charge or discharge.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How often should a battery be charged?</b></p>

<p>Ans. At least once in two weeks, even if the use be only
slight in proportion to the output capacity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In charging a storage battery, it is essential to remember the fact that
the normal charging rate is in proportion to the voltage of the battery.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_919">919</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>Thus, a 100 ampere hour battery, charged from a 110 volt circuit at
the rate of ten amperes per hour, would require ten hours to charge, and
would consume in that time an amount of electrical energy represented
by the product of 110 (voltage) by 10 (amperes) which would give
1,100 watts, or 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>10</sub> kw.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,118.—Diagram illustrating method of charging storage battery of stationary gas engine
ignition system; the system is simple to install and will give satisfactory results. Two
storage batteries are used, one being charged while the other is operating the sparking
coil. Where charging current is available at the point where the batteries are used,
the following diagram shows the system of connections, which can be easily followed,
A represents the source of charging current and B the bank of lamps (or other resistance,
such as an ordinary rheostat) sufficient to cut down the charging voltage to that required
by the battery. C and D are two double pole double throw knife switches connected at
their hinges to two batteries, E and F, each consisting of a group of cells. G represents
the leads to the sparking coil terminals. From the diagram, it will readily be seen that
by throwing the switches in opposite directions one battery will be charging while the
other battery is discharging to the engine, thus giving a constant source of supply, and
insuring that the spare battery will be full and ready for service by the time the other
is discharged. The method of determining the necessary resistance for cutting down the
line voltage for charging the battery is illustrated by the following example: If a battery
require about 3 amperes for charging, how is this current obtained from a 110 volt circuit?
Each 16 candle power carbon filament lamp in the lamp bank would give approximately
<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub> ampere with the cells in series in the lamp circuit. Therefore, 3 x 3 or 9 lamps should
be used in parallel to give 3 amperes.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. If in charging a battery, one or more of the
cells do not boil at the completion of the charge, or fail
to show the proper voltage, what should be done?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The charging must be continued until the cadmium
test shows the required voltage, but if the prolonging of the charge
be liable to damage the plates in the other cells, the defective
cell or cells should be cut out of circuit when the battery discharges
and then placed in circuit again when the battery is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_920">920</span>
recharged. If the desired result cannot be attained by this
method, the plates which require additional charging may be
charged in a separate cell.</p>

through carelessness or neglect, that the storage battery is discharged so low that the
engine explosion will not take place, and it is necessary to run somehow or other for a
short time. In such cases the following suggestion may be followed: If there be two storage
batteries, connect them in series. If there be one storage battery and a set of dry cells,
connect the positive terminal of the storage battery to the negative or outside terminal of
the dry cell; set and connect to the coil leads as if they were one battery. The above
suggestions should only be followed in emergency, for it may injure the coils, and is harmful
to the battery.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How is the cadmium test made?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A plate of cadmium is mounted in a hard rubber frame
and immersed in the electrolyte. The test consists in taking
voltage readings between the cadmium plate and the positive or
negative plates of the cell. During charge the cadmium plate
reads negative to the negative plate, until the cell is about full,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_921">921</span>
when the reading should be zero; the charge should be continued
until the cadmium reads 0.2 volt positive to the negative while
charging at the normal rate.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Name some portable instruments that should
be provided for testing batteries.</b></p>

<p>Ans. 1, a hydrometer syringe (specific gravity tester); 2, an
acid testing set (can be used instead of the syringe); 3, a low
reading voltmeter; 4, suitable prods, and 5, a thermometer.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What precaution should be taken in charging
a battery?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Care should be taken not to have a naked flame anywhere
in its vicinity.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>To either charge or discharge a battery at too rapid a rate involves
the generation of heat. Thus, while this is not liable to result in a flame
under usual conditions, the battery may take fire, if it be improperly
connected or improperly used.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of varying the charging current?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In charging a storage cell, particularly for the first time,
a weaker current than that specified may be used with the same
result, provided the prescribed duration of the charge be proportionally
lengthened. The battery may also be occasionally
charged beyond the prescribed voltage, ten or twenty per cent.
overcharge effecting no injury, although if frequently repeated,
it shortens the life of the battery.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the charge indications?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The state of the charge is not only indicated by the
density of the electrolyte and the voltage of the cell, but also by
the <i>color of the plates</i>, which is considered by many authorities
as one of the best tests for ascertaining the condition of a battery.

</div>
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Figs.</span> 1,121 and 1,122.—Two methods of charging from a direct current lighting system. The simplest method of charging is from
an incandescent light circuit, using lamps connected in parallel to reduce the voltage to that of the battery, the current being
adjusted by varying the number of lamps in circuit. The group of lamps is in series with the battery to be charged, and
the combination is connected across the circuit furnishing the current. If the charging source be a 110-120 volt circuit, and
the rate required be 6 amperes, twelve 16 c. p. or six 32 c. p. lamps, in parallel, and the group in series with the battery,
will give the desired charging rate, unless high efficiency lamps be used, when more will be required. In case a lower charging
rate, say 2 amperes be used, then a proportionately fewer number of lamps will be needed; but the length of time required
to complete the charge will be correspondingly increased. Instead of lamps, as in <a href="#fig1121">fig. 1,121</a>, a rheostat is sometimes used, as
shown in fig 1,122. Its resistance should be such as to produce, when carrying the normal charging current, a drop in volts
equal to the difference between the pressure of the charging source and that of the battery to be charged; thus, if a battery
of three cells, giving 6 volts, is to be charged from a 110 volt circuit at a 6 ampere rate, the resistance would be, according
to Ohm's law,<br />

<span class="table">(110 - 6) &divide; 6 = 17.3 ohms.</span><br />

The carrying capacity of the rheostat should be slightly in excess of the current required for charging. An ammeter with
suitable scale should be inserted in the battery circuit to indicate the current. For charging more than one battery at a time
from a 110 volt circuit, the batteries should be connected in series (positive terminal of one battery to the negative of the
next, and so on). The charging rate should be that of the battery with the lowest rate. The resistance to be inserted will
be less than if only one battery is being charged; where lamp resistance is used, <i>this means more lamps in parallel</i>. Care
should be taken to remove each battery from the circuit as it becomes charged, inserting additional resistance to take its place.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_923">923</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What are the colors of the plates?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In the case of formed plates, and before the first charging,
the positives are of a dark brown color with whitish or reddish
gray spots, and the negatives are of a yellowish gray. The whitish
or reddish gray spots on the positive plates are small particles of
lead sulphate which have not been reduced to lead peroxide during
the process of forming, and represent <i>imperfect sulphation</i>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As a general rule, the first charging should be carried on until these
spots completely disappear. After this the positive plates should be of
a dark red or chocolate color at the end of the discharge, and of a wet
slate or nearly black color when fully charged. A very small discharge
is sufficient, however, to change them from black to the dark red or
chocolate color.</p>

<p>If the battery has been discharged to a pressure lower than 1.8 volts,
the white sulphate deposits will reappear, turning the dark red color to
a grayish tint in patches or all over the face of the plate, or in the form
of scales of a venetian red color.</p>

<p><i>The formation of these scales</i> while charging indicates that the maximum
charging current is too large and should be reduced until the scales or
white deposits fall off or disappear, after which the current can be
increased again.</p>

<p>During charging, the yellowish gray color of the negatives changes
to a pale slate color which grows slightly darker at the completion of
the charge. The color of the negatives always remains, however, much
lighter than that of the positives.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How are the best results obtained in charging?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The rate of charge should be normal, except in cases of
emergency. At such a rate, unless the constant voltage method
be employed, the cell may be considered full when the voltmeter
reads 2.5 volts during charge. The electrolyte should be kept
at uniform density throughout the cell; when water is added,
because of evaporation, it should be added by means of a funnel
reaching to the bottom of the cell. Care should be taken never
to add acid after evaporation; otherwise the electrolyte will be
too heavy. Hydrometer readings should be taken regularly;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_924">924</span>
the reading is an excellent indication of the amount of charge in the
battery. Hydrometer readings are useless, however, unless the
precaution be taken to keep the electrolyte of uniform density.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What voltage should be used in charging?</b></p>

<p>Ans. At the beginning of the charge the voltage should be
about 5 per cent. higher than the normal voltage of the battery,
unless the latter has been overdischarged, in which case the
difference of pressure should not exceed 2 per cent., otherwise
the current might be too large.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. In what two ways may batteries be charged?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They may be charged either at constant current or at
constant voltage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Although the latter method is considered the better one by many
authorities, it is a fact, nevertheless, that if the charging current be
normal at the beginning of the charge, and no means be provided for
keeping it constant, it will diminish as the charging progresses, thereby
greatly increasing the length of the time required for charging, and
resulting in serious injury to the plates.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_925">925</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How may the charging current be kept constant?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Its voltage should be gradually increased, first to about
10 or 15 per cent. above the voltage of the battery, and kept at
that point nearly to the end of the charge, where in consequence
of the rapid rise of pressure in the battery it might become
necessary to increase the voltage of the current to 30 or 40 per
cent. above the normal of the battery.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. What tests should be made while charging?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Occasional voltage and cadmium readings of each cell
should be taken for the purpose of ascertaining their condition
and the behavior of the separate plates.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What tests should be made after charging?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Each cell should be tested with a low reading voltmeter
and hydrometer about once a week. If any cell read low, it
should be cut out and examined to see if any material has been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_926">926</span>
introduced which would cause a short circuit.  If this trouble
do not exist, the cell should be given an independent charge.</p>

<p><b>Charge Indications.</b>—The state of the charge is not only
indicated by the density of the electrolyte and the voltage of the
cell, but also by the <i>color of the plates</i>, which is considered by
many authorities as one of the best tests for ascertaining the
condition of a battery.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the case of formed plates, and before the first charging, the positives
are of a dark brown color with whitish or reddish gray spots and the negatives
are of a yellowish gray. The whitish or reddish gray spots on the
positive plates are small particles of lead sulphate which have not been
reduced to lead peroxide during the process of forming, and represent
<i>imperfect sulphation</i>.</p>

<p>As a general rule the first charging should be carried on until these
spots completely disappear. After this, the positive plates should be of
a dark red or chocolate color at the end of a discharge and of a wet
slate or nearly black color when fully charged. A very small discharge
is sufficient, however, to change them from black to the dark red or
chocolate color.</p>

<p>If the battery has been discharged to a pressure lower than 1.8 volts,
the white sulphate deposits will reappear turning the dark red color to a
grayish tint in patches or all over the surface of the plate, or in the form
of scales of a venetian red color.</p></blockquote>

<p>The <i>formation of these scales</i> during charging indicates that
the maximum charging current is too large and should be reduced
until the scales or white deposits fall off or disappear, after which
the current can be increased again.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the behavior of the electrolyte during
discharge.</b></p>

<p>Ans. There is a definite change in the density of the electrolyte
for a given amount of discharge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The density of the electrolyte is, therefore, one of the best indications
of the state of charge, provided, of course, no internal discharge due to
local action takes place. If, when the cell is charged, it show a density
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_927">927</span>
of 1.200, and when discharged 1.130, the difference .07 represents the
total charge. If at any time the density be 1.165, then just one half the
amount of capacity has been taken from the cell.</p>

<p>It is necessary to stir the electrolyte well, in order for these observations
to be reliable.</p>

<p>If the discharge has taken place at a high rate, the cell must stand for
an hour or more before the electrolyte will completely diffuse so that
the density readings are correct.</p></blockquote>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. Define the term "boiling."</b></p>

<p>Ans. Boiling means the rapid evolution of gas when a cell is
nearly charged.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What causes boiling?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The amount of sulphate to be converted into peroxide
becomes less and less as the charge progresses and the plates
therefore become virtually smaller, so that the current becomes
too large for the work demanded of it. The result is, that
part of the current not actually used in the formation of peroxide
decomposes the electrolyte into its constituent elements.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_928">928</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. Why do the gases evolved produce a less milky
appearance of the electrolyte when a battery has been in
use for a considerable time?</b></p>

charging current can be used without producing "boiling".</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said of charging a battery as
quickly as possible?</b></p>

<p>Ans. As a general rule, such a procedure should not be
adopted unless the battery be thoroughly discharged.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What precaution should be taken?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The danger to be avoided in rapidly charging a cell is
its tendency to heat.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What apparatus is necessary in charging a battery?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The battery may be charged from direct current mains
having the proper voltage. A current as near uniform as possible
is required, and existing conditions must be met in each separate
case. Sometimes a motor dynamo set with a regulating switchboard
is used. Such an apparatus consists of a direct current
dynamo, driven direct from the shaft of a motor, which, in turn,
is energized by current from the line circuit.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>With a direct current on the line, a direct current dynamo may be
used; but with an alternating current an induction motor is required.
The speed of the motor is governed by a rheostat, and the output of the
dynamo is thus regulated as desired.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Charging Through the Night.</b>—If an electric vehicle, after
a late evening run, is to be used in the morning, the battery
may be charged during the night without an attendant being
present; but in doing this great care must be taken not to excessively
overcharge.</p>

<p>A careful estimate of the amount of current required should be
made and the rate of charge based on this estimate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>If, say, 72 ampere hours be required to recharge, and the time available
is nine hours, the average rate of charge must be 8 amperes.</p>

<p>If charging from a 110-volt circuit, the rate at the start should be
about 10 amperes; if from a 500-volt circuit, about 9 amperes; as, in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_930">930</span>
charging from a source with constant voltage, such as a lightning or
trolley circuit, the rate into the battery will fall as the charge progresses.
This also applies if the charging be done from a mercury arc rectifier
without attendance.</p></blockquote>

<p>Ans. When a battery is being overhauled, the cells must be
connected together in series and to the charging source in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_931">931</span>
relatively the same manner as if they were in the vehicle; that is,
the positive (+) terminal of one group of cells must be connected
to the negative (-) terminal of the next group, and the two free
terminals, one positive and the other negative, must be connected
respectively to the positive and negative terminals of the
charging circuit, but not until all of the groups have been connected
in series. Great care must always be taken to have the
polarities correct and the wire or cable for the connections of
ample size to carry, without heating, the heaviest current used
in charging.</p>


<p><b>Charging Small Cells.</b>—For cells of the portable type, having
capacities from 10 to 100 ampere hours, the normal charging and
discharging rate should be about one-tenth the stated capacity,
but the discharging rate may be increased to double this value, in
case of necessity.</p>

<p>If the cells be provided with formed plates and not charged, the
jars should be filled with the proper electrolyte, and then charged
for at least 10 hours steady, or until they boil, then they may be
discharged.</p>

<p>In the case of unformed plates, the charging should be from
30 to 40 hours, until the cells boil, and the plates assume their
proper color.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are small cells easily charged from 110 or
220 volt circuits?</b></p>

<p>Ans. This may be conveniently done by inserting in one of
the charging leads an incandescent lamp which will pass the
required quantity of current. If the current required be as large
as 10 amperes, a suitable resistance or 10 lamps in parallel, each
passing one ampere, may be used. Great care should be taken
to see that the battery is connected properly.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_932">932</span></p>

<p><b>Period of Charging a New Battery.</b>—In the case of batteries
provided with formed plates, the first charge should extend over
a period of not less than 30 consecutive hours, without stopping,
if possible, or for periods of not less than 10 hours a day for three
consecutive days. The electrolyte will then commence to "boil"
or "gas," assuming a milky appearance due to the ascending
bubbles of gas. At this stage the density of the electrolyte as
shown by the hydrometer placed in each cell should be at least
1.200; it is essential that the charging should be continued until
every cell boils equally. From this point the charging should be
prolonged until the pressure, as determined by a voltmeter or a
cadmium tester, rises to about 2.55 volts.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,130.</span>—The Willard underslung battery box for automobiles. The general tendency
in automobile design, is to keep everything off the running board as far as possible, and
to get tool boxes, battery boxes, etc., placed somewhere under cover. To meet these
conditions the box here illustrated is arranged so that it can be underslung beneath the
rear footboard or supported on auxiliary cross members made of strap iron and attached
to the side members of the chassis. It is usually suspended under the rear footboard or
the rear seat. The box has a chemically treated wood lining to make it acid proof. The
lining is so made that there is air space between the battery and the sides of the box,
except at the corners. Ventilation is thus obtained and the battery kept dry. Accumulation
of water or spilled electrolyte in the bottom of the box is prevented by grooves
in the bottom board, extending downward from the corners to an outlet at the center
of the board. The box is also fitted with rubber bushings in the holes where wire
leaves the battery box.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The charging of unformed plates is similar in all respects to that of
formed plates, except that the first charging should extend over a period
of at least 70 consecutive hours without stopping, at the end of which
time the plates should have the characteristic colors of those of a fully
charged battery. If they do not, the charging should be prolonged and
the cell tested for density of electrolyte, and voltage, as already described
until the desired conditions are attained. Then the battery
may be discharged and recharged.</p>

<p>It is probable that a total of 300 to 400 hours of charging with intervening
discharges will be required to form the plates until they acquire
a good color, and the density of the electrolyte becomes stable.</p></blockquote>

<p>In regular charging, the rate should be rapid when the
battery is nearly exhausted, but it should be greatly reduced
at the end of the charge after passing the point of boiling.
Charging at too low a rate is always injurious.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What may be said with respect to the capacity
of a new battery?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A new battery will never give its full capacity till after
about twenty discharges. During this time it should be given
about 25% overcharge. After that, 10% overcharge, that is,
10% more charge than was taken out, will be sufficient for ordinary
work.</p>

<p><b>High Charging Rates.</b>—Occasionally it is desirable to charge
a battery as quickly as possible. As a general rule, such a
procedure should not be adopted unless the battery be thoroughly
discharged, and not then, unless done by a person who
thoroughly understands what he is about; battery makers will
always furnish data and directions to meet emergencies.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In charging a battery at a high rate, the danger to be avoided is the
tendency of the cells to heat. The troubles that might arise from this
cause may be prevented by immediately reducing the current strength.
The proper rate of charge for a given battery of cells may be thus discovered
by experiment. A battery should never be charged at a high
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_934">934</span>
rate unless it be completely exhausted, since it is a fact that the rate of
charge that it will absorb is dependent upon the amount of energy
already absorbed.</p></blockquote>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,131.—Instructions for taking voltage readings ("National" batteries). The batteries
are made up of several cells, usually two or three, each cell representing approximately
2 volts when battery is on "open circuit" (neither charging nor discharging). It is sometimes
advisable to take individual readings of the cells, both to determine on charge
if all the cells be evenly charged, and also on discharge to be sure that the cells are evenly
discharged. To do this, a low-reading voltmeter must be used with prods attached to
the voltmeter leads that can be forced into the terminals so as to insure good contacts.
To test the positive end cell, put the positive prod on the positive terminal of the battery
and the negative prod into small hole back of positive terminal in hard rubber cover.
Middle cell (in 6 volt, type "Y" batteries) is tested by inserting the positive prod in the
small hole back of the positive terminal, and the negative prod in small hole back of
negative terminal. In the 120 ampere hour, Auto type of battery, the middle cell is
tested by inserting the positive prod in the small hole back of the positive terminal and
the negative prod on the middle terminal. The negative end cell is tested by putting
the negative prod on the negative terminal and the positive in the small hole in rubber
cover back of the negative terminal. A charging cell at end of charge should read about
2.55 volts. A fully charged cell on open circuit should read about 2.1 volts. Since open
circuit readings vary under different conditions, as to age, acid, etc., little significance
should be attached to them. A discharged cell voltage will vary considerably with the
many different coils, engines, etc., but in the majority of cases should read between 1.8
to 1.9 volts, while motor is in operation.</p>

<p><b>Mercury Arc Rectifier.</b>—This is a device for obtaining direct
current from alternating current for use in charging storage
batteries. The transformation is obtained at a low cost, because
the regulation is obtained from the alternating side of the rectifier,
while the current comes from the direct current side.</p>

<p>The theory is as follows: In an exhaust tube having one
or more mercury electrodes, ionized vapor is supplied by the
negative electrode or cathode, when the latter is in a state of
"excitation." This condition of excitation can be kept up only
as long as there is current flowing toward the negative electrode.</p>

<p>If the direction of the voltage be reversed, so that the formerly
negative electrode is now positive, the current ceases to flow,
since in order to flow in the opposite direction it would require
the formation of a new negative electrode, which can be accomplished
only by special means. Therefore, the current is always
flowing toward one electrode—the cathode, which is kept excited
by the current itself. Such a tube would cease to operate on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_936">936</span>
alternating current voltage after half a cycle if some means were
not provided to maintain a flow of current continuously towards
the negative electrode.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the construction and operation of a
mercury arc rectifier.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Fig. 1,135 is an elementary diagram of connections. The
rectifier tube in an exhausted glass vessel in which are two
graphite anodes A, A&acute;, and one mercury cathode B. The small
starting electrode C is connected to one side of the alternating
circuit, through resistance; and by rocking the tube a slight arc
is formed, which starts the operation of the rectifier tube. At
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_937">937</span>
the instant the terminal H of the supply transformer is positive,
the anode A is then positive, and the arc is free to flow between
A and B. Following the direction of the arrow still further, the
current passes through the battery J, through one-half of the
main reactance coil E, and back to the negative terminal G of
the transformer. When the impressed voltage falls below a
value sufficient to maintain the arc against the reverse voltage
of the arc and load, the reactance E, which heretofore has been
charging, now discharges, the discharge current being in the same
direction as formerly. This serves to maintain the arc in the
rectifier tube until the voltage of the supply has passed through
zero, reversed, and built up such a value as to cause the anode A
to have a sufficiently positive value to start the arc between it
and the cathode B. The discharge circuit of the reactance coil E
is now through the arc A'B instead of through its former circuit.
Consequently the arc A'B is now supplied with current, partly
from the transformer, and partly from the reactance coil E. The
new circuit from the transformer is indicated by the arrows enclosed
in circles.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How is a mercury arc rectifier started?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A rectifier outfit with its starting devices, etc., is shown
in figs. 1,132 to 1,134. To start the rectifier, close in order named
line switch and circuit breaker; hold the starting switch in opposite
position from normal; rock the tube gently by rectifier
shaker. When the tube starts, as shown by greenish blue light,
release starting switch and see that it goes back to normal
position. Adjust the charging current by means of fine regulation
switch on the left; or, if not sufficient, by one button of
coarse regulation switch on the right. The regulating switch
may have to be adjusted occasionally during charge, if it be desired
to maintain the charging current approximately constant.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_938">938</span></p>

<p><b>Capacity.</b>—The unit of capacity of a storage cell is the
<i>ampere hour</i>, that is, the ability to discharge one ampere continuously
for one hour. For instance, a 100 ampere hour battery
will give a continuous discharge of 12&frac12; amperes for eight
hours. It should theoretically give a discharge of 25 amperes
continuously for four hours, or 50 amperes for two hours, but
in reality, the ampere hour capacity decreases with an increase
of discharge rate.</p>

<p>It requires, theoretically .135 ounces of metallic lead on either
element reduced to sponge lead or to lead peroxide to produce
one ampere hour; in practice, from four to six times this amount
is required.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reason for this is because it is impossible to reduce all the active
material, to bring every particle in contact with the electrolyte, or to
cause every part to be penetrated by the current.</p></blockquote>

<p>Experiments show that from .5 to .8 ounces of sponge lead,
and from .53 to .86 ounces of metallic lead converted into
peroxide, are required on their respective elements to produce
a discharge of one ampere hour at ordinary commercial rates.</p>

<p>The capacity increases with the temperature, being about one
per cent. for each degree Fahr. increase in temperature.</p>

<p>Battery capacity depends on the size and number of plates;
the quantity of active material present, and the quantity of
electrolyte.</p>

<p>For an eight hour rate of discharge and 60 degrees temperature,
the capacity of American batteries varies from 40 to 60
ampere hours per square foot of positive plate surface ( = 2 &times;
number of positive plates in parallel &times; length &times; breadth).</p>

<p>The following table gives the variation of capacity for
different rates of discharge:

<p><b>Ques. How may the capacity of a battery be increased?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By mixing organic materials with the lead oxide, <i>but
any such mixture is always accompanied by a rapid deterioration
of the plates</i>.</p>

<p><b>Discharging.</b>—In discharging a battery its voltage should
never be allowed to fall below 1.8 volts, under load, thus leaving
about 30 per cent. of the total capacity unused. The normal
discharging current may be equal to the normal charging current,
but a discharge equal to 3 or 4 times the normal may be given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_940">940</span>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_941">941</span>
without injury to the plates. Some types may be discharged at
even six or seven times the normal rate. In such cases, however,
the capacity will be reduced in the same proportion, as before
explained in the paragraph dealing with battery capacities.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of discharging too rapidly?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It tends to break the plates, and in the case of pasted
plates, a very sudden discharge will dislodge the paste.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How is the discharge capacity of a storage battery
stated?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In ampere hours. This, unless otherwise specified, refers
to its output of current at the eight hour rate. Most manufacturers
of automobile batteries specify only the amperage of
the discharge at three and four hours. Thus, at the eight hour
rate, a cell which will discharge at ten amperes for eight hours
is said to have a capacity of eighty ampere hours. It does not
follow that eighty amperes would be secured if the cell were
discharged in one hour. It is safe to say that not more than forty
amperes would be the result with this rapid discharge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>As a general rule, the one hour discharge rate is four times that of the
normal, or eight hour discharge, and considerations of economy and
prudence suggest that it should never be exceeded, if, indeed, it ever be
employed. The three hour discharge, which is normally twice that of
the eight hour, is usually the highest that is prudent, while the four hour
discharge is the one most often employed in vehicles for the average
high speed riding.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What should be the maximum rate of discharge?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The one-hour rate; this when used, should not extend
over fifteen or twenty minutes. In the case of regulating batteries
a forty-five minute rate of discharge may be allowed for one
or two minutes during great fluctuations of load.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_942">942</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How does the capacity decrease?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It decreases with the increase in current output.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>An 80 ampere hour cell, capable of delivering 10 amperes for 8 hours,
would, when discharged at 14 amperes, have a capacity of 70 ampere
hours; when discharged at 20, its capacity would be 60; and when discharged
at 40, its capacity will have decreased from 80 to 40 ampere hours.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<h3>Operation of Edison Rectifier</h3>

<p>The operation of the Edison rectifier
may be explained as follows
with the aid of figs. 1,154 to 1,156
(the parts being uniformly lettered
in the figures): The primary circuit
taken from the alternating current
mains by the cord B, embraces
the primary winding of the transformer
T, a condenser C, and the
coils P, of the vibrating units, <a href="#fig1155">fig.
1,155</a>.</p>

<p>The secondary circuit from the
transformer embraces the massive
carbon and copper contacts (N and
O, <a href="#fig1156">fig. 1,156</a>) which pass only the
positive waves of the alternating
current, for charging batteries or
other duty.</p>

<p>An ammeter and rheostat may be
placed in this charging circuit if the
current is to be varied, or a fixed
connection may be substituted on
the base of the rectifier if it is to be
used for the maximum duty of 8 or
16 amperes.</p>

<p>The vibrating unit (<a href="#fig1155">fig. 1,155</a>),
which operates in a manner similar
to the well known action of a polarized
relay, includes a permanent
magnet M; the coil in the primary
circuit P; the vibrating armature of
steel with removable carbon contact
N; the stationary copper contact
with comb top for heat radiation O,
and the screw Q for adjusting the
amplitude of the armature vibration.</p>

<p>The vibrating armature of each
unit is divided into two parts, which
gives flexibility, affords increased
current capacity and minimizes
sparking, the two leads shown
being connected together in one
circuit.</p>

<p>A primary relay and a secondary
switch (E and F, <a href="#fig1154">figs. 1,154</a> and
1,156), close their contacts when
current is flowing.</p>

<p>Upon failure of the main alternating
current line they operate to open
the charging circuit. A storage battery
is thus prevented discharging
through the rectifier.</p>

<p>Upon resumption of the main
alternating current, the rectifier
starts automatically.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_946">946</span></p>

<p>Every battery room should be provided with a water tap and
sink. The floor should be paved with vitrified brick, preferably blue
or yellow in color, of diamond pattern and sloping in all directions
toward suitable drains. A floor of this type can be easily washed
by flooding with water, and its patterns tend to keep it dry
under foot at all times. Wooden floors are rotted very quickly
by acid spillings and by the spray.</p>

<p>The room should be kept absolutely clear of everything,
which may be injured, by the sulphuric acid fumes and it
should be well ventilated to insure the safety and good health
of the attendants.</p>

<p>A battery, even at rest, gives off hydrogen which when diluted
with air forms a mixture which is very liable to explode if brought
in contact with any kind of flame. Unless proper ventilation be
provided, the breaking of the connection when a current is flowing,
or the lighting of a bare flame lamp in the battery room
would be dangerous.</p>


<p><b>Battery Attendants and Workmen.</b>—Those employed in
setting up batteries are liable to suffer from soreness of hands
and the destruction of clothing unless proper precautions be
taken to prevent the same. In order to avoid these troubles,
the boots should be painted with paraffine mixed with an equal
quantity of beeswax.</p>

<p>The clothing should be of woolen material, which, unlike
cotton, is practically unaffected by the acid. If cotton shirts
be worn, they should be dipped in a strong solution of washing
soda and then rough dried.</p>

<p>An apron of sacking, backed with flannel should be worn over
all the other clothes. A bottle of strong ammonia should be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_947">947</span>
kept in the battery room at all times, and in case of an accidental
splash of acid on the clothes, the immediate application of a
small quantity of the ammonia, by means of the stopper, will
at once neutralize the acid and prevent it burning a hole in
the material. A pail containing water made strongly alkaline
with washing soda should also be kept conveniently at hand
during all operations in the battery room. The hands should be
dipped occasionally in this water in order to prevent the skin
smarting and becoming sore under the action of the acid.</p>

<p>If a splash of acid should happen to enter the eye, it should be

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_948">948</span></p>


<p><b>Points on Care and Management.</b>—In setting up storage
cells, they should be placed in as few tiers as possible, and in
such a manner that the direct rays of the sun are not allowed to
fall upon the cells. The rays of the sun are likely to crack the
glass. This is probably due to the unequal expansion of the
glass, for it has been found that jars which are carefully annealed
never crack in this manner. Of course, the latter precaution
does not apply to large batteries, where lead lined wooden tanks
or solid lead boxes are used.</p>

<p>In installing plants where expert attendance is not to be had,
it is well to place in the circuit two magnetic cut outs, one set
for maximum current, and the other for minimum voltage, so
that the battery cannot be discharged too low.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should the cells be placed?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be placed as shown in <a href="#fig1137">fig. 1,151</a>, on insulators
A, resting on wooden stringers B, and supporting pieces
C placed on the floor. The insulators are usually of glass
or porcelain, which in certain patterns may be filled with oil, to
insure better insulation as shown in figs. 1,165 and 1,166.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In setting up a battery, it should be remembered that plates deteriorate
on standing exposed to the air. They should, therefore, be unpacked
and set up immediately on arrival. When they are entirely connected
up, they are ready for the addition of the electrolyte, and for the forming
charge, which they should receive immediately.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How should the wooden stringers, shelves, cell
boards, and trays be treated?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be thoroughly varnished to insure cleanliness
as well as good insulation.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Outside of each cell and close to the mouth, melted paraffine should
be applied by means of a brush, so as to form a band about an inch wide,
for the purpose of preventing the electrolyte creeping over the top of
the jar, wetting the outside, and thereby impairing the insulation.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_949">949</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What should be done to avoid waste of current
by leakage?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Each cell of the battery must be thoroughly insulated.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of verdigris which forms on
the terminals?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is a poor conductor and should therefore be removed
and the terminals kept bright and clean to insure the proper
flow of the current.</p>

current is available, recharging may be done by means of the charging plug. First
insert the plug in a regular socket. Then screw a 50 c.p. lamp into the plug and
turn on. To tell the positive from the negative, lay both wires on a small piece of
red litmus or test paper moistened. The negative wire makes a mark on the paper.
This wire must go to the negative post of battery. This will fully charge the "6-25-G"
battery in 15 to 20 hours.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What precautions should be taken in unpacking
cells?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The plates should be handled carefully.  When they
are sent out from the factory already built into sections, they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_950">950</span>
should be unpacked without disturbing a single plate. In all
cases, every particle of packing, straw, hay and any chips and
bits of parts should be carefully removed, and all the dust
should be blown out of the spaces between the plates by means
of a bellows or other similar device.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—<i>Champion directions for repairs.</i> To replace broken jars in a battery remove
the lid and lift out elements bodily. Empty the good jars with a syringe or by tilting the battery
over. Never put the acid in any vessel except glass, stone or lead. Put new jars in place
same as others and run melted paraffine around the edges. The wax must be broken off the
elements that are to go into new jars and be poured on again. Fill the jars with acid to &frac34;"
from tops. Melt the broken wax in a tin ladle and pour over the acid about &frac12;" thick. Do not
fill with wax to tops of jars. When the wax gets cold it will be found to have shrunk away
from the edges of the jars. Fill up the opening with a little melted paraffine wax by means
of a squirt can. Cut a small hole in the middle of the wax seal for a vent. Smear the brass
posts and terminals and inside of case with vaseline to prevent creeping of the acid. The
"6-25-G" requires one-half gallon of acid and the "6-50-G" one gallon.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Although such particles are good non-conductors, the action of the
sulphuric acid electrolyte carbonizes them, giving them conducting
properties which tend to produce leakage.</p></blockquote>

1, a dynamo run by belt from main engine; 2, a storage battery, and 3, a switchboard
to regulate, measure and control the current.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How should the cells be assembled?</b></p>

<p>Ans. In placing the plates or plate sections in the containing
jars or tanks, care should be taken to see that the supporting
frame of paraffined wood bears evenly on the bottom of the jar.
If they do not, wedges of paraffined wood should be placed under
the frame, so as to distribute the weight of the section equally.
Each section should be lowered gently into the jar until it rests
fairly upon the frame, and care should be taken to see that none
of the plates have shifted, and that the section is situated centrally
in the jar, with a small clear space all around.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_951">951</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. How should the cells be arranged?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be so placed that the battery attendant
can see the edges of the plates and consequently the spaces between
them at the same time.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the method of connecting the cells.</b></p>

<p>Ans. This is accomplished by means of solder, bolts and nuts,
or clamps, according to circumstances. The use of solder is not
essential if there be a good surface of the lead strip of one cell
in contact with that of the next, and provided these contact
surfaces have been well cleaned. Usually, the ends of the lead
strips are turned up so that the junction of two cells takes the
form of an inverted T as shown in <a href="#fig1162">fig. 1,162</a>.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,162.</span>—Two storage cells; view showing the inverted T form of connection.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What precaution should be taken in joining the
terminals of the cells?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The contact at the junctions should be very thorough,
otherwise they will become heated when a current is flowing, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_952">952</span>
it is desirable that the connections should include as little lead
strip in the circuit as possible, thereby reducing the amount of
useless resistance.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Brass or gun metal clamps may be kept clean by brushing them over
with melted paraffin after they have been screwed up tightly. When
thus treated they serve to indicate points of bad contact by heat, generated
at such points, when the current is flowing, softening the paraffin
and changing its normal color. Vaseline and different kinds of anti-sulphuric
acid varnishes, or preparations that are not attacked by the
electrolyte, may also be used for this purpose. It is a good plan to color
the varnish with vermillion or lamp black and paint the positive connections
red and the negative connections black, and also other parts
of the installation for distinguishing the polarities.</p></blockquote>


<p><b>Cell Connections.</b>—The cells may be connected together
either in series or parallel, or in parallel-series or series-parallel
combinations, according to the requirements, but in all cases
it is best to use the simplest arrangement practicable.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>For instance: if the cells employed in an installation requiring 110
volts, have only half the capacity required, and 55 cells give the desired
voltage, then the number of cells must be increased to 110, and theoretically
the required number of amperes hours at 110 volts may be
obtained in one of two ways: 1, by connecting the cells in pairs in parallel
and then coupling the pairs together in series, and 2, by arranging the
110 cells in two complete batteries of 55 cells each connected in series,
then coupling the two batteries in parallel.</p>

<p>The first method is quite impracticable, however, as the slightest
difference between the voltages of the two cells of any pair will result
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_953">953</span>
in the one having the greater pressure discharging into the other, thereby
causing the entire battery to quickly deteriorate.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—<i>To determine the positive wire.</i> Without a voltmeter, the positive terminal
of the charging circuit can be determined by attaching a piece of clean lead to each wire which
is to be connected to the battery, and immersing them, without touching each other, in a
glass or other insulating vessel containing water to which is added a drop or two of sulphuric
acid. After the current has passed through the circuit for a short time, the positive lead will
commence to discolor, and, if left long enough, will turn brown. Bubbles will arise from the
two terminals immersed, the larger and more frequent ones being from the negative, the
smaller ones from the positive.</p>

<p>NOTE.—<i>Method of disconnecting "National" cells.</i> There are two methods of disconnecting
the cells employing link connectors. First a ⅝ inch bit or twist drill may be used,
boring down into the top of the posts about &frac14; inch. The link will then be loosened and can
be removed. This leaves the link, as well as the post, in good condition for reburning. Second
the link may be cut in the center. A flame should be played on the top of the post, at the
same time grasping the end of the half link firmly with pliers. When the connection has
become warmed (care being taken not to melt the lead) the half link can be twisted loose from
the port. New links may be used if desired in re-assembling the cells. It is not necessary to
remove the covers from the element, the links may be cut in the center and the plates removed
from the jars without removing the links from the ports. The links can be afterwards reburned
together in the center. When the cells are equipped with "T" or "L" straps, they
should be cut apart with hack saw or chisel midway between the cells, and in re-assembling,
burned together at this point.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Battery Troubles.</b>—To successfully cope with faults in
storage batteries, there are two requisites: 1, a thorough knowledge
of the construction and principle of operation of the battery,
and 2, a well ordered procedure in looking for the source of
trouble. The faults which are usually encountered by those who
operate storage batteries are here given.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig1163" src="images/fig1163.jpg"

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig. 1,163.</span>—Arrangement of battery cells and stand. A, cable lugs; B, bus bars; C, glass
tanks; D, plate; E, glass insulators; Q, vitrified brick; O, lead washers. Battery cells
are set up on stands; the one shown being built for a 100 ampere battery. Larger sizes
would, of course, require heavier stands, and if space be limited, the cells may be set
in rows, one above the other. However, it is evidently much better to place the cells in
single rows, where they will be convenient for inspection and repairs or any work that
has to be done on them. There are several other ways of setting a battery, one of
which is to place the stringers on the floor, on vitrified brick or some other insulator, and
then place trays filled with sand on the stringers, setting the cells in the trays on glass
insulators. The battery room should be dry, clean, well ventilated and free from metal
work, also neither too hot nor too cold. Too high a temperature in the battery will
shorten the life of the plates, and although there is no danger of the battery freezing, a
low temperature, while it is maintained, reduces the capacity; otherwise cold has no ill
effect on the battery. A good temperature for the battery room is about 60&deg; F.
A damp, dirty room is conductive to grounds and surface leakage, and there is danger
of impurities getting into the cells. If the room be very damp the electrolyte may absorb
enough moisture to cause the cells to overflow. Strong floors are necessary to support
a battery, as one of a 100 ampere, 125 volt capacity weighs from 12 to 13 tons. A wood
floor may be used, but a cement floor is better, and a glazed vitrified brick floor is better
still. Wooden floors will rot quickly from the acid, which is sure to get onto it more or
less; a cement floor will be disintegrated if too much acid get onto it. This kind of floor
forms a first class ground if there be any chance for one; the glazed brick floor is not
affected by the acid and is an insulator.</p>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_954">954</span></p>

<p><b>Short Circuiting.</b>—A form of derangement that may occasionally
affect storage batteries is short circuiting. It may be
caused by some of the active material—if the cell be of the
pasted variety—scaling off and dropping between the plates, or
by an over collection of sediment in the bottom of the cell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Should the operator suspect trouble with his battery he may discover
a short circuited cell by the marked difference in color of the plates or
of the specific gravity of the electrolyte, as compared with the other
cells. No particular damage will be caused, if the trouble be discovered
and removed before these symptoms become too marked.</p>

<p>If a foreign substance has become lodged between the plates, it may
be removed by a wood or glass instrument.</p>

<p>If some of the active material has scaled off, it may be forced down
to the bottom of the jar. If excessive sediment be found, the jar and
plates should be washed carefully, and reassembled.</p></blockquote>

<p>A cell that has been short circuited may be disconnected from
the battery and charged and discharged several times separately
which may remedy the trouble.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are internal short circuits indicated?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Short circuits in a cell are indicated by short capacity,
low voltage and low specific gravity, excessive heating and
evaporation of the electrolyte.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How are internal short circuits located?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If the trouble cannot be located by the eye, the battery
should be connected in series and discharged at the normal rate
through suitable resistance. If a suitable rheostat be not available,
a water resistance may be used.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>This consists of a receptacle (which must not be of metal) filled with
very weak acid solution, or with salt water in which are suspended two
metal plates, which are connected by wires through an ammeter. The
current may be regulated by altering the distance between the plates,
or by varying the strength of the solution. As the discharge progresses
the voltage will gradually decrease, and it should be frequently read at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_955">955</span>
the battery terminals; as soon as it shows a sudden drop, the voltage of
each cell should be read with a low reading voltmeter.</p>

<p>While the readings are being taken, the discharge rate should be kept
constant and the discharge continued until the majority of the cells
read 1.70 volts; those reading less should be noted. The discharge
should be followed by a charge until the cells which read 1.70 volts are
up, then the low cells should be cut out, examined, and the trouble
remedied.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Overdischarge: Buckling.</b>—On account of unequal expansion
of the two sides of a plate, or certain portions thereof, the
strains thus set up may distort it and cause it to assume a buckled
shape, that is, bent so one side is concave.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<img id="fig1164" src="images/fig1164.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,164.—Method of straightening a buckled plate. Buckling is caused by the unequal
expansion of the plates which is due to the sulphate lodging on the plates, thus preventing
action taking place at that point; and by excessive charging. If the plates be not badly
buckled, they can be placed between 2 boards and with a little pressure, can be straightened
out.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>Buckling is due always to over discharge on either the whole, or some
portion of the plate. Occasional buckling may occur with too rapid
charge and discharge.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Sulphation of Plates.</b>—During discharge a storage cell deteriorates
on account of the formation of lead sulphate over the
surface of the plates. This lead sulphate is the product of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_956">956</span>
chemical combination of active material with the electrolyte.
It is a non-conductor, white in color and of greater volume, in
proportion than the active material. When the discharge is
over prolonged, sulphation is evidenced by the electrodes becoming
lighter in color, because of the sulphate which lessens the
active surface.</p>

a number of open cells are in use, unless precautions be taken, electrical leakage between
the cells invariably occurs. This leakage is due chiefly to the semi-conducting nature of
the thin layer of moisture which frequently covers not only the glass containing cells,
but the unimmersed parts of the elements, and even the shelves on which the cells rest.
To prevent this waste of energy, the outside of the cells should occasionally be well cleaned
and thoroughly dried. A little vaseline or tallow may then be rubbed over them to
advantage. The shelves or supports for the cells, should either be well varnished or coated
with paraffin wax. Electrical leakage is greatly reduced if each cell be mounted on a
glass or earthenware insulator, as shown in the illustrations. The insulator here shown
is in two parts and of a mushroom shape. The lower cup contains a small quantity of
some non-evaporating oil, and as the conducted moisture cannot bridge across this, a
nearly perfect insulating medium is obtained. These insulators are made in various
sizes and may be obtained in earthenware or glass. Those made of glass are found to
give the best results.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Name some causes of sulphation.</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is sometimes caused by a too weak or too strong acid
solution, but more generally by continued over discharging, or
too rapid discharging of the batteries, or by allowing them to
remain uncharged for long periods of time.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of sulphation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It tends to cause shedding of the active material, buckling
of plates, loss of capacity, increase of resistance and consequent
reduction of efficiency, and increase of temperature with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_957">957</span>
flow of current. A sufficient amount of lead peroxide and sponge
lead must be retained on the plates to reduce this resistance,
otherwise the charging current cannot flow through the active
material and regenerate the battery.</p>

</div>

<p><b>Ques. What should be done in case of sulphation?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Charge the battery below the maximum rate, necessarily
prolonging the charge, until the plates assume the proper
color. This is a tedious task, but it must not be hastened, as
rapid charging will cause serious buckling.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—<i>How to destroy acid vapor in storage battery rooms</i>: The best remedy is a
good system of thorough and rapid ventilation; failing this the evil effect of the acid may be
minimized by the fumes of a powerful alkali such as ammonia, which will readily combine with
the sulphuric acid to form sulphate of ammonia, an inert and harmless salt. If the use of
liquid ammonia be objectionable, the granulated carbonate of ammonia will do equally well.
The ammonia fumes are best obtained by placing dilute ammonia in shallow dishes, so that an
extensive evaporating surface is obtained. In the same way the corroding dew which is so
frequently deposited on the lugs and connectors of storage battery elements may readily be
neutralized by the application of a solution of ammonia, or even common washing soda. A
good method of protecting metal work in battery rooms is to smear it over evenly with vaseline.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_958">958</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The charging should be done at low rates. Discharge should not be
carried below 1.8 volts per cell, and the charging current should be
stopped when each cell shows 2.4 volts.</p>

<p>If the plates be in a very bad condition, a little of the white sulphate
deposit on each of the positive plates may be removed with a stick, thus
exposing a part of the good surface to the action of the electrolyte.</p>

<p>If the positive plates cannot be restored to their proper color as directed,
it is cheaper to replace them by a new set, rather than to attempt
their recovery by means of reversals.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Lack of Capacity.</b>—This is usually due to the clogging of
the pores in the plate with sulphate which is invisible because the
surface of the plate is maintained in proper condition but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_959">959</span>
interior portions of the active material have not been thoroughly
reduced. To correct this condition, the battery should be given
a prolonged overcharge at low current rates, say about one fourth
the normal 8 hour charging rate.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—<i>Oxide of lead</i>, <i>litharge</i>, or <i>plumbic oxide</i> is sometimes found native as lead ochre,
and may be artificially made by heating the carbonate or nitrate. It is usually prepared on
a larger scale by heating the lead in air. When the metal is only moderately heated, the oxide
forms a yellow powder which is known as massicot, but at a higher temperature the oxide melts,
and on cooling, it forms a brownish scaly mass, which is called flake litharge. The scaly
pieces are afterwards ground between stones under water, forming buff or levegated litharge.
The litharge of commerce often has a reddish yellow color, due to the presence of some of the
red oxide of lead, and frequently from one to three per cent. of finely divided metallic lead is
found mixed with it. When heated to dull redness litharge assumes a dark brown color, and
becomes yellow again on cooling. At a bright red heat it fuses and readily attacks clay crucibles,
forming silicate of lead. Litharge is a most powerful base, and has a strong tendency to
form basic salts. Hot solution of alkalies, as potash or soda, readily dissolve it, and on cooling,
it crystalizes out in the form of beautiful pink crystals.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote>

<p>Falling off in the capacity may be caused by a dry cell, due to a
leaking jar; some or all of the cells may be in a state of incomplete
charge, due to the battery having been run too low and not sufficiently
charged; or the plates may be short circuited, either by the sediment
(deposit in the bottom of the jar) getting up to the bottom of the plates
or by something that has fallen into the cell.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What action takes place when a battery stands
idle for some time?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It loses part of its charge, due to local losses in the cells.</p>

<p><b>Ques. How should batteries be treated, when used but
occasionally?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If a battery is not to be used for several days, it should
first be fully charged before standing; if it continue idle, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_960">960</span>
freshening charge should be given every two weeks, continuing
the charge when the cells begin to gas freely.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What should be done in case of lack of capacity?</b></p>

<p>Ans. If the current consumption be normal, there may be
poor connections or trouble in the battery; there may be a dry
cell, due to a leaking jar; some or all of the cells may be in a state
of incomplete charge, due to the battery having been run too low
and not sufficiently charged, or the plates may be short circuited,
either by the sediment (deposit in the bottom of the jar) getting
up to the bottom of the plates or by something that has fallen
into the cell.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—<i>Peroxide of lead, pure oxide or plumbic dioxide</i> is the true active material in all
forms of lead storage cell. This lead salt is found native as the mineral plattnerite. It is
a heavy lead ore, forming black, lustrous, six sided prisms. It may be prepared from the red
oxide by boiling it in fine powder, with nitric acid diluted with five parts of water, or by treating
the carbonate when suspended in water with a stream of chlorine gas, and then thoroughly
washing and drying it. It is reduced to a lower oxide on heating or by exposure to bright
sunlight. This salt readily imparts oxygen to other substances; it becomes heated to redness
when thrown into sulphuric dioxide, and takes fire when triturated with sulphur—hence this
oxide is a common ingredient in lucifer match composition. When used in primary or secondary
batteries it readily imparts its oxygen to nascent hydrogen, forming water, and thus it acts
as a powerful depolarizer. When robbed of its oxygen, it readily becomes reoxidized, if subjected
to the action of nascent oxygen liberated by the electrolytic decomposition of water.</p></blockquote>

<p>If the trouble cannot be located by the eye, connect the battery in

very weak acid solution or salt water in which are suspended two metal
plates, which are connected, by wires through an ammeter.</p></blockquote>

<p>The current may be regulated by altering the distance between the
plates or by varying the strength of the solution. As the discharge
progresses, the voltage will gradually decrease and it should be frequently
read at the battery terminals. When it shows a sudden drop, the
voltage of each cell should be read with a low reading voltmeter.</p>

<p>While the readings are being taken, the discharge rate should be
kept constant and the discharge continued until the majority of the cells
read 1.70 volts; those reading less should be noted. The discharge should
be followed by a charge until the cells which read 1.70 volts are up; then
the low cells should be cut out, examined and the trouble remedied.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>NOTE.—<i>How to prevent lead poisoning.</i> Workmen employed in the manufacture of
lead or lead salts are always liable to lead poisoning, both by inhaling the dust and by contact
of the materials with the hands. Various preventives for this have been employed, and of
these, the most simple seems to be a careful washing of the hands in petroleum. It is said
that three washings a day are sufficient to prevent all serious danger of poisoning. The
benzole in the petroleum appears to scour the skin and remove the loose lead dust, and the
fatty substance in the oil fills up the pores of the skin and prevents the absorption of the
deleterious salts. The employment of petroleum has given such good results that it has been
proposed to use this material as a guard against poisoning in other industries where the salts
of copper or mercury are employed.</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_962">962</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What causes low specific gravity when there are
no short circuits?</b></p>

<p>Ans. 1, sloppage or a leaky jar (the loss having been replaced
with water alone), 2, insufficient charge, 3, over discharge, or
4, a combination of these abuses. Any of these mean that there
is acid in combination with the plates.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In this case the acid should be brought out into the electrolyte by a
long charge at a quarter of the normal discharge rate.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. How should weak cells be treated?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They should be grouped by themselves and charged as
a separate battery, care being taken that the positive strap of one
cell, is connected to the negative strap of the adjoining cell and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_963">963</span>
that the charging connections are properly made. If there be
not sufficient resistance in the charging rheostat to reduce the
current to the proper point, a water resistance should be used.</p>

<p><b>Disconnecting Cells.</b>—The best method of disconnecting
cells assembled with pillar straps, for the purpose of replacing
broken jars, cleaning or taking out of commission, is to use a
five-eighth inch twist drill, in a carpenter's brace, boring down
into the top of the pillar about one-quarter inch; then pull off
the connector sleeve from the pillar. By following this method,
all parts may be used again.</p>

The pure concentrated commercial acid has a density which usually reaches 1.842, and its
boiling point is about 640&deg; F. The absolutely pure acid is perfectly colorless, but usually
even that used in laboratories has a peculiar grayish color, due to slight traces of organic
matter. Sulphuric acid is exceedingly hydroscopic, and when exposed to the air it rapidly
increases in bulk, owing to absorption of atmospheric moisture.</p>

<p>NOTE.—Clamps not made of metal similar to that of the connecting strips, frequently
give trouble from the galvanic action due to the contact of dissimilar metals in the presence of
moisture which causes the destruction of either the connecting strip or the clamp. Such
troubles can be avoided by placing a thin strip of sheet zinc between the lead strip and the
clamp. Under these circumstances the zinc will crumble away, and can be replaced without
much inconvenience and very little expense, while the clamps and connecting strips will remain
uninjured.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the method of taking a battery out of
commission.</b></p>

<p>Ans. The battery is charged in the usual manner, until the
specific gravity of the electrolyte of every cell has stopped rising
over a period of one hour (if there be any low cells, due to short
circuits or other cause, they should be put in condition before
the charge is started, so that they will receive the full benefit
of it). The cells may now be disconnected and covers and
elements removed from the jars, (if sealed, the compound is
loosened with a hot putty knife). The elements are placed on
their sides with the plates slightly spread apart at the bottom, the
separators withdrawn, and the positive and negative groups
pulled apart. The electrolyte is washed off with a gentle
stream of water and the plates allowed to drain and dry.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_966">966</span>
The positive plates are ready to be put away. When dry, the
negatives are completely immersed in electrolyte (of about 1.275
specific gravity), and allowed to soak for three or four hours.
The jars may be used for this purpose. After rinsing and
drying, they are ready to be put away; wash also the rubber
separators.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Wood separators, after having been in service, will not stand much
handling and had better be thrown away. If it be thought worth while
to keep them, they must be immersed in water or weak electrolyte, and
in re-assembling, the electrolyte must be put into the cells immediately,
as wet wood separators must not stand exposed to the air.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Condensed Rules for the Proper Care of Batteries.</b>—The
following general instructions should be followed in the care and
maintenance of batteries:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>1. A battery must always be charged with "direct" current and in
the right direction.</p>

<p>2. Be careful to charge at the proper rates and to give the right
amount of charge; do not undercharge or overcharge to an excessive
degree.</p>

<p>3. <i>Do not bring a naked flame near the battery while charging or immediately
afterwards.</i>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_968">968</span></p>

<p>4.  Do not overdischarge.</p>

<p>5.  Do not allow the battery to stand completely discharged.</p>

<p>6.  Voltage readings should be taken only when the battery is charging
or discharging; if taken when the battery is standing idle they are of
little or no value.</p>

<p>7.  Do not allow the battery temperature to exceed 110&deg; Fahr.</p>

<p>8.  Keep the electrolyte at the proper height above the top of the
plates and at the proper specific gravity. Use only pure water to replace
loss by evaporation. In preparing the electrolyte <i>never pour water into
the acid</i>.</p>

<p>9.  Keep the cells free from dirt and all foreign substances, both solid

<h2>CHAPTER XLV<br />

<small id="STORAGE_BATTERY_SYSTEMS">STORAGE BATTERY SYSTEMS</small></h2>


<p>Storage batteries are used for many purposes, such as to
supply current for electric vehicles, gas engine ignition, lighting,
and in connection with power stations and distribution work.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The latter is an important field, the storage battery being used
in connection with the power station for the following purposes:</p>

<p>
1. To carry the peak load, during hours of maximum demand;<br />
2. To carry the entire load during hours of minimum demand, or for a short time in case of emergency;<br />
3. To act as an equalizer;<br />
4. For regulation of load and voltage;<br />
5. As compensation for feeder drop;<br />
6. As a preventive against shut downs.<br />
</p>

<p>In almost every electric lighting plant there are long periods
during the day and late at night when the number of lamps
lighted is so small that it may not pay to run the generating
machinery. In such cases, storage batteries may usually be
used to advantage to aid in carrying the maximum load and to
supply the entire current at minimum load as illustrated in <a href="#fig1179">fig.
1,179</a>. In other words, batteries are substituted for a certain
portion of the machinery plant or are used in place of the latter.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_970">970</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What provision must be made in power plants
when storage batteries are not used?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The capacity of the generating machinery must be sufficient
for the heaviest overloads which may occur, and it must
be operated continuously for 24 hours a day in the majority of
central stations supplying current for lighting and power.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What results are obtained with this method of
working?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The engines working under very variable loads, not
only operate at low efficiency, but are continually subjected to
severe mechanical strains.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig1179" src="images/fig1179.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,179.—Load curve showing use of storage battery as an aid to the generating machinery.
In the diagram, it is seen that the battery discharges at minimum and maximum loads
and is charged at other times, the battery furnishing current for the entire minimum load
and part of the maximum load.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How may greater efficiency be secured with
steam engines under variable loads?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Judicious selection of the number and sizes of the
engines enable them to be worked in most cases at a considerable
fraction of their full capacity nearly all the time.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_971">971</span></p>

<p><b>Ques. What further improvement is secured in most
cases with the storage battery?</b></p>

<p>Ans. The plant is made more flexible, and the economy of the
engines is increased by making their loads nearer uniform, and
nearer to full capacity while they are running.</p>

<p><b>Ques. What is the effect of a battery connected in
parallel with a dynamo, as in <a href="#fig1180">fig. 1,180</a>?</b></p>

<p>Ans. It is not necessary for the dynamo to have a capacity
exceeding that which is sufficient for the average daily load, at
which it may be worked practically all the time.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig1180" src="images/fig1180.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,180.—Storage battery connected in parallel with a dynamo. This arrangement enables
the dynamo to be stopped for a considerable portion of the time, and thus save labor
and attention. It also acts to prevent fluctuations as in a dynamo driven by a gas engine
whose speed varies periodically because of the nature of its cycle of operation.</p>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p>When the load is below the average, the dynamo charges the battery,
and when the load rises above the average, during the hours of maximum
demand, the battery discharges into the line in parallel with the dynamo.
During the hours of minimum demand the engines may be shut down
and the necessary current supplied from the battery alone, thus not only
increasing the efficiency of the plant, but serving to maintain a steadier
pressure under fluctuating loads.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. What is understood by the expression "floating
the battery on the line"?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A storage battery is said to <i>float</i> on a line when connected
across the circuit at some distance from the power station,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_972">972</span>
so that a heavy load on the line, within the range of the battery
influence, causes sufficient line drop to allow the battery to discharge,
while with a light load on the line, the drop is small and
the impressed voltage at the battery high enough to charge the
battery. This usage is confined chiefly to electric railway
service, where large voltage changes are permissible.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,181.—Diagram showing effect of storage battery in regulating the dynamo load in a combined
railway and lighting plant. In this case the average and line loads are about equal
and the battery covers the instantaneous fluctuations. It will be noted that while the line
load fluctuations vary between 780 and 1,420 amperes, those of the dynamo load are kept
at an average between 1,030 and 1,160 amperes.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. When the battery is floated on the line, how may
the amount of charge be made to approximately equal the
amount of discharge?</b></p>

<p>Ans. By properly proportioning the number of cells in series.</p>

<p><b>Connections and Circuit Control Apparatus.</b>—When a
storage battery is used in an electric lighting plant, provision
must be made for feeding the lamps, etc., from either the dynamo
or battery separately, or from the two working in parallel, and it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_973">973</span>
should be possible to charge the battery at the same time the
lamps are being supplied. To accomplish these results requires
three switches, for the following connections:</p>

<p>
1.  To connect the lamps to the dynamo;<br />
2.  To connect the lamps to the battery;<br />
3.  To connect the battery to the dynamo.<br />
</p>

<hr class="chap" />

figure shows an actual load curve from an Edison station for 24 hours. A sudden storm
caused the load to be thrown on very quickly, the peak of the load being higher than usual.</p>
</div>

<p>In some plants, the first switch is omitted, because the lamps
are always fed by the battery alone, the latter being charged during
the day, when no lamps are in use.</p>

<p>It is desirable, however, to have all three switches in every
plant in order to be able to supply lamps and charge the battery
at any time.</p>

<p>In the battery circuit there should be an ammeter having a
scale on both sides of zero, to show whether the battery is being
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_974">974</span>
charged or discharged, as well as the value of the current. Another
similar ammeter is required in the circuit between the
dynamo and the battery, to show the direction and amount of
current. A third ammeter is desirable in the lamp circuit, to
show the total current supplied to the lamps, but it need only
indicate on one side of zero, since the current there always flows
in the same direction.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,183.—Diagram showing three wire system with one dynamo and storage battery. A
220 volt dynamo charges a storage battery of corresponding pressure, which in turn
subdivides the pressure and supplies a three wire system, the neutral wire of which is
connected to the middle point of the battery as shown.</p>
</div>

<p>A voltmeter is required with a three-way switch to connect it
to the dynamo, battery or lamps, and a circuit breaker must be
inserted in the battery circuit in order that it may be opened
when the current becomes excessive.</p>

<p>A discriminating cut out or reverse current circuit breaker is
required between the dynamo and the battery to open the circuit
when the charging current falls below a certain value, and thus
avoid any danger of the battery discharging through the
dynamo, if from any cause the voltage of the latter drop below
that of the battery. This completes the ordinary measuring and
circuit controlling apparatus employed with storage batteries.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_975">975</span></p>

<p><b>Methods of Control for Storage Batteries.</b>—As the external
voltage of a storage battery varies with the amount of charge
it contains and with the direction of the current, it is necessary
to employ some means for compensating this variation in order
to maintain a constant voltage on the line supplied by the battery.
The various devices used for this purpose are as follows:</p>

<p>
1.  Variable resistances;<br />
2.  End cell switches;<br />
3.  Reverse pressure cells;<br />
4.  Boosters.<br />
</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,184.—Diagram showing connections for ignition outfit. The charging switch has four
indications&mdash;"Off," "Battery," "Dynamo" and "Charge." When engine is at rest
switch is turned to "Off." The first turn brings it to "Battery," enabling the engine
to be started. Next turn cuts battery off and puts "Dynamo" direct on engine. The next
turn brings the switch to "Charge." Dynamo then charges the battery and surplus
current is stored up. Next turn is "Off," which stops engine and disconnects battery
from dynamo. Test the dynamo wires with test paper (negative makes mark). Put
positive of dynamo to positive of battery. Dynamo should be regulated to charge at
about four amperes.</p>
</div>

<p>The particular method selected will depend upon the size of
the battery, the purpose for which it is used, the allowable limits
pf current and voltage variations, the cost of the system, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_976">976</span></p>

<p><b>Variable Resistance.</b>—Regulation by variable resistance may
be used advantageously only with batteries of small capacity,
and in small lighting plants such as those of yachts, where the
space available for battery auxiliaries is limited, and where the
cost of energy is so low that the loss of power in the resistance is
not objectionable.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,185.—Variable resistance method of regulation for storage battery; diagram showing
connections for charging two halves of a battery in parallel.</p>
</div>

<p>The connections for one of the simplest methods is shown in
<a href="#fig1185">fig. 1,185</a>. The battery is divided into two halves, which are connected
in series for discharging and in parallel for charging.
Since the voltage of each cell at the end of a discharge should not
be lower than 1.8 volts, a battery intended for use on a 110 volt
lighting circuit will require 110 &divide; 1.8 = 62 cells. The voltage
necessary, however, for each cell at the end of a charge is about
2.6 volts, or a total of 2.6 &times; 62 = 161 volts for the battery, a value
which is far above the line voltage. By dividing the battery into
two halves and connecting them in parallel only 80.5 volts are
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_977">977</span>
necessary for charging. The excess voltage of the line, 29.5 volts
is taken up by the resistance, which also controls the output of
the battery on discharge.</p>

<p><b>End Cell Switches.</b>—These may be used to advantage in
small installations where there is not demand for current during
the day, or where the charging is done by means of <i>boosters</i>.</p>

In the diagram the voltmeter and voltmeter connections have been omitted. The bus
bars on the battery panel are connected directly to the bus bars on the dynamo panel.
In this installation the dynamos are run during the afternoon on discharge, being regulated
by means of an end cell switch. On charge, the pressure above that of the bus bars,
required to bring all cells up to full charge, is supplied by means of a motor driven charging
booster, the voltage at the armature being suitably varied by changing the field excitation.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. What is an end cell switch?</b></p>

<p>Ans. A form of switch employed in connection with a storage
battery in order to control the end cells for regulating the voltage.</p>

<p><b>Ques. Describe the construction of an end cell switch.</b></p>

<p>Ans. This is shown in <a href="#fig1187">fig. 1,187</a>. The switch contact arm is
made in two parts, A and B, which are insulated from each other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_978">978</span>
as shown, and connected with each other through the protective
resistance R. The end cell contacts are so spaced that when the
main current carrying part A of the switch arm is squarely on one
end cell contact such as X, the part B, does not touch any other
contact such as Y, but when the switch arm is advanced for
cutting into circuit another end cell, the part B, reaches the
contact Y before the part A, leaves the contact X, thus keeping
the battery circuit closed, while the resistance R, limits the
current in the short circuited cell at the instant the switch arm
passes from one end cell contact to the next.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="figcenter">
<img id="fig1187" src="images/fig1187.jpg"
alt="" />
<p class="hang"><span class="smcap">Fig.</span> 1,187.—Diagram of end cell switch. This form of switch controls several cells at one end
of a storage battery and is used for regulating the voltage. The requirement of an end
cell switch is that in switching from one end cell contact to another, the discharging circuit
must not be opened, neither must the moving arm touch one contact before leaving the
one adjacent, since the joining of two contacts will short circuit the cells connected thereto.
To accomplish this, the spacings of the two arms and contacts are such that when the
main arm A is squarely on an end cell contact, the advance or auxiliary arm B touches no
other contact, but in passing from one point to the next, the advance arm reaches the
contact toward which it is moving before the main arm leaves its contact. The resistance
X, between the two points prevents short circuiting, and the current to the main circuit
is never broken.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. How should the conductors joining the end cells
to the end cell switch contacts be proportioned?</b></p>

<p>Ans. They must have the same sectional area as the conductors
of the main circuit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_979">979</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>The reason for this is that when any end cell is in use, the conductor
connecting it to the switch becomes a part of the main circuit.
An allowance of 1,000 amperes per sq. in., when the battery is discharging
at the two-hour rate, is considered good practice.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Ques. Describe some of the features of end cell
switch construction.</b></p>

<p>Ans. Those of small capacity are made circular; the larger
sizes are made horizontal in form, and both types may be either
operated by hand or motor driven.</p>

when the battery is being charged.</p>
</div>

<p><b>Ques. Where are end cell switches of large capacity
located?</b></p>

<p>Ans. Generally they are placed as near the battery room as
possible to avoid the cost of running the heavy conductors, and
when such switches are motor driven, the usual practice is to
control their operation from the main switchboard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_980">980</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>In <a href="#fig1188">fig. 1,188</a> is shown the method of regulation with an end switch.
The diagram shows the battery being charged with the main switch
open, and the voltage of the dynamo raised to the charging pressure.
During discharge the cells are connected in series, and as the voltage
of each cell at the beginning of discharge is at least 2.1 volts, only
52 or 53 cells are required to give the desired pressure of 110 volts, but
as the discharge continues, and the voltage of each cell decreases,
the end cells, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc., are cut into circuit successively by means
of the end cell switch, thereby adding to and compensating the drop in
the total voltage until, at the end of discharge when the voltage of each
cell has fallen to 1.8 volts, the entire 62 cells are in series to supply the
required line pressure.</p></blockquote>

in such instances this method of charge and discharge control is the usual practice. In case
the dynamo from which the battery is charged has sufficient range in voltage to charge
all cells in series, a charging booster is not required, nor is it necessary to connect groups
of cells in parallel, as the dynamo voltage may be varied as charge proceeds.</p>

<p><b>Reverse Pressure Cells.</b>—These consist of unformed lead
plates immersed in the ordinary electrolyte of dilute sulphuric
acid. As they have no active material, they possess no capacity,
but are capable of setting up an opposing pressure of about
2 volts each to the discharging current flowing through them,
thereby cutting down the total voltage of the battery, so that
the net voltage across the line depends on the number of reverse
current cells in series in the battery circuit. As the voltage of
the battery falls during discharge, the reverse pressure cells are
cut out, successively, thus keeping the external or line voltage
constant.</p>

in an electrolyte of dilute sulphuric acid. They have no capacity but set up an opposing
or reverse voltage of approximately 2 volts per cell if current be passed through them.
In using these cells for controlling discharge, the total number of active cells in the battery
will be the same as if the method of end cell control had been used. Reverse pressure cells
represent an increase in equipment of about 8 per cent. or more. These cells, as shown,
are connected in the circuit in opposition to the main battery, and conductors are run
from each of them to points on a switch similar to an end cell switch. At the beginning
of discharge, all the reverse cells are in circuit, acting in opposition to the main battery.
As discharge proceeds and the battery voltage falls, the reverse cells are gradually cut
out of circuit. The only advantage in this method of regulation is that the discharge
throughout the battery is uniform, but this fact alone does not warrant such means of
regulation on account of the additional expense involved, and the energy loss when discharging
against reverse cells is the same as if resistance had been placed in the circuit.</p>
</div>

<p>It is obvious, that as these cells do not possess any capacity,
the number of active cells required in the battery will be the
same as when end cell control is employed. Therefore, the
reverse pressure cells represent an increase in equipment, which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_982">982</span>
entails an additional expense of at least 8 per cent. For this
reason, and also on account of the fact that the amount of
energy lost in discharging against reverse pressure cells, is the
same as when the resistance methods of controlling the discharge
are employed, the use of cells for this purpose is now practically
obsolete.</p>

The booster field winding has one terminal connected to the middle point of the battery
and the other terminal, to the wire joining the resistances A and B. A lever, pivoted at L,
carries at either end a number of contact points which dip into troughs of mercury when one
end of the lever moves upward or downward. These points are connected to corresponding
points on their respective resistances, and therefore all of the resistances connected
to contact points which are immersed in the mercury are short circuited. The points are
of various lengths, so that when the lever operates, they contact progressively with the
mercury. If more of the A points than the B points be immersed in the mercury, the
resistance of B is less than that of A, more sections of it being short circuited. Current
will therefore flow from the middle point of the battery, through the booster field, and
through B to the negative side of the system, exciting the booster field and producing a
booster voltage to charge the battery. Again, if more of the A points be immersed, the
A resistance becomes the smaller, and current then flows from the positive side of the
system through resistance A, through the booster field to the middle point of the battery,
the field excitation and the booster pressure produced being in a direction opposite to
the first described, and tending to discharge the battery. When the resistances A and B
are equal, there is no pressure to send current in either direction through the booster field
coil. When the load on the external circuit is normal, the lever is in a horizontal position,
A and B being equal, no current flows through the booster field hence, no current passes
into or out of the battery. With increase of external load, the pull of the solenoid is
strengthened by a small increase in dynamo current passing through the winding. This
draws down the left end of the lever producing a current in the booster field such as to
discharge the battery and assist the dynamo to supply the load demand. A decrease in
external load is attended by a slight diminution in dynamo current, the solenoid is weakened
and the pull of the spring predominates. This results in a downward movement of the
right side of the lever causing excitation of the booster field to produce a pressure to send
charge into the battery.</p>

field winding is connected at one end to the middle point of the battery. The other end
is connected to the upper contact points of two carbon pile resistances, A and B. The
lower end of A is connected to the negative side of the battery, and the corresponding end
of B, to the positive side. This arrangement constitutes in effect a potentiometer. If the
resistance of A be equal to that of B, there is no pressure in the booster field to establish
current through it. The drop through A + B is equal to the total battery voltage, and
if A = B, the drop from either side of the battery through A or B is one-half the total
drop, hence the end of the booster field winding, connected to the upper ends of A and B
is also at the pressure of the middle point of the battery which is likewise the pressure of
the other side of the booster field coil. Accordingly when A = B, there can be no
current through the coil. When the two resistances are unequal, there will be current
through the booster field, its direction depending on which of the resistances is the less,
and its magnitude will be proportional to the difference between the two resistances.
Variations in the pressure on a carbon pile causes variations in its resistance and the solenoid,
M, opposed by spring S, both pulling on lever L which rests on the two piles A and B,
controls the relative resistances of the two piles to cause charge and discharge of the
battery. The solenoid winding is in series with the dynamo circuit and when the load
is normal, the spring pull is just equal to the magnet pull, and the resistance of A and B

<blockquote>

<p>If the load on the external circuit be small, the dynamo voltage rises
and current flows into the battery. In this case the series field acts
against the shunt field and decreases the booster voltage so that the
pressure at the dynamo is greater than booster and battery voltage
combined, thus increasing the rate of charge of the battery until the load
causes the dynamo voltage to drop to normal and the system is again
balanced.</p>

<p>The battery and booster can be placed at the power house or where
the greatest drop is likely to occur. As this system, like the series
booster, depends for its action upon the drop of voltage with increase of
load, it is only adapted to shunt wound dynamos.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_991">991</span></p>

<p>From the foregoing description it will be seen that the compound
booster is automatic within certain limits of battery charge. Any
marked change of battery voltage will be followed by a corresponding
change in dynamo current, unless the rheostat be manipulated to
bring battery voltage + booster voltage back to normal.</p>

<p>While the theoretical dynamo current variation is small for a given
change of load, there is always a sudden, momentary, current rush from
the dynamo on increase of load, the duration of which is equal to the
time lag of magnetization of the booster field.</p>

<p>Lights on a circuit with variable load will "wink" on sudden changes
of load. In this respect the compound booster is not so satisfactory as
the constant current booster, as in the latter <i>all</i> dynamo current passes
through the series fields, which, by reason of their self-induction, oppose
and check any sudden current rush, giving the booster field time to
change its magnetization to the proper degree.</p></blockquote>

the field produced by the series coil, the resulting magnetization being, in direction and
amount, the resultant of the two field strengths. The adjustments are so made that
when the normal dynamo current is passing through the series coil, the shunt field just
neutralizes its effect, and the resultant magnetization is zero. Since the open current
voltage of the battery is equal to that of the system, neither charge nor discharge takes
place. With increased demand on the line, the slight increase in dynamo current in the
series coil overpowers the shunt field, and causes a pressure in the booster armature in
such direction as to assist discharge. If the external load fall below the average demand,
the current in the series coil decreases slightly so that the shunt field predominates, producing
a booster armature pressure in a direction to assist charge. Although the voltage
of the battery falls while discharging by an amount proportional to the outflowing current
the increased excitation due to this current through the series coil is also proportional to
it, and the booster voltage rises as that of the battery falls, their sum being always equal

lower than normal, it will not discharge rapidly enough to relieve the dynamo from overload
fluctuations, unless the booster voltage be increased, and the dynamo will therefore
have to supply a current greater than normal. If a current greater than normal flow
through the compensating coil, the effect of the shunt coil opposed by the series coil is
decreased, and the compensating coil, acting in the same direction as the series coil, causes
a higher booster pressure tending to discharge the battery, and thus brings down the
dynamo load to normal. Should the battery voltage be above its normal value, the battery
would discharge too rapidly and carry more than its share of the load. In operating this
system, the varying load must be beyond the booster equipment. The series and compensating
coils may be temporarily short circuited so that the battery may be charged

practically unvarying current from the lighting to the power bus bars, regardless of the
fluctuations of the external load, which current is equal to the average required by the
fluctuating load. Except under abnormal conditions the shunt field always predominates
giving a voltage which is added to that of the lighting bus bars, so that the voltage across the
power busses is always higher than that across the lighting by an amount equal to the
booster voltage. If an excessive load come on the power circuits, the increased excitation
of the series coil, due to a slight increase in current from the lighting to the power bus
bars, lowers the booster voltage and consequently reduces the voltage across the power
bus bars. The battery discharges, furnishing an amount of current equal to the difference
between that required by the load and the constant current through the booster. If the
power load decrease below normal, the slight decrease in current in the booster series field
increases the booster armature voltage and the excess current goes into the battery. The

<p>When the load decreases below the normal, the current in the
exciter field is decreased, and its armature voltage falls below that
of the system. Current will now flow in an opposite direction
in the booster field coil, generating a voltage in the booster armature
to assist charge. Since the exciter always generates a voltage
in opposition to that of the line, this system is known commercially
as the counter pressure system.

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">1</a>
 NOTE.—The term <i>impedance</i> means the total opposition in an electric circuit to the flow of
an alternating current, being made up of the actual or ohmic resistance and the apparent resistance
due to self-induction, or if the circuit contain also capacity, the resultant apparent
resistance due to self-induction and capacity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">2</a>
 NOTE.—The international ohm &divide; B. A. ohm = 1 &divide; .9866. The B. A. ohm &divide; International
ohm = 1 &divide; 1.0136. Hence, to reduce British Association ohms to International ohms, divide
by 1.0136. or multiply by .9866.</p></div>

 This size can be used only in the shape of flexible cord.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_4" href="#FNanchor_4" class="label">4</a>
 <b>CAUTION.</b>—The size thus obtained should be compared with the table of carrying capacity
of wires as given on <a href="#Page_731">page 731</a> to see if the wires would have to carry more than the
allowable current.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_5" href="#FNanchor_5" class="label">5</a>
 NOTE.—In case a larger loss than any given in the table is required, proceed as follows:&mdash;Divide the ampere feet by 10 and
then refer to column of Actual Volts Lost divided by 10, from which the size of wire is found as before.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_6" href="#FNanchor_6" class="label">6</a>
 NOTE.—<i>Specific gravity</i> is the weight of a given substance relative to an equal <i>bulk</i> of
some other substance which is taken as a standard of comparison. Water is the standard for
liquids. In the laboratory the <i>specific gravity bottle</i> is often used in determining the specific
gravity of a liquid. The capacity of the bottle is 1,000 grains of pure water. When it is filled
with spirits of wine and weighed in a balance (together with a counterpoise for the weight of
the bottle, which of course is constant), it will weigh considerably less than 1,000 grains; in fact,
the bottle will contain only about 917 grains of proof spirit; therefore, taking the specific gravity
of water as unity, 1 or 1.000, the specific gravity of spirits of wine is 0.917. If, on the other
hand, the bottle be filled with sulphuric acid, it will weigh about 1,850 grains; hence, the specific
gravity of sulphuric acid is said to be 1.850. A more convenient method for the automobilist
is by the use of the hydrometer.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_7" href="#FNanchor_7" class="label">7</a>
 NOTE.—If the active material in the negative plates extend beyond the ribs of the grid
(the supporting frame), it should be at once pressed back into place, care being taken to prevent
the plates drying before this is done. The most suitable and convenient method for pressing,
is to place between the plates smooth boards of a thickness equal to the distance between the
plates and then put the groups under pressure.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_8" href="#FNanchor_8" class="label">8</a>
 NOTE.—The voltage increase or decrease with change in current is practically constant
in a given type of cell for any size of cell when the current is referred to a given time rate of
charge or discharge; that is, the drop in a large cell or in a small cell, when each is discharged
at its four, six or eight hour rate, will be the same. The drop varies somewhat for the condition
of the battery charge. For batteries which are one-third discharged, the temperature
60&deg; Fahr., and plates in good condition, the changes in pressure which may be expected between
open circuit voltage and the voltage on charge or discharge are given in the above table.</p></div></div>
